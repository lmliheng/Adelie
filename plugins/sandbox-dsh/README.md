# DeepSeek Harness sandbox adaptor

Puts the **DSH** sandbox ecosystem behind this harness's own sandbox interface. This is the
portable floor: it works on Linux, macOS and Windows, and implements the `fs-write`
dimension.

## What it covers

`@deepseek-ai/dsh-sandbox-local` carries the platform chain and probes each rung
functionally:

| Host | Mechanism |
| --- | --- |
| Linux | dsh-bwrap → Landlock |
| macOS | Seatbelt |
| Windows | ACL restricted-token runner |

DSH's policy vocabulary governs **file-write effects only**, so this adaptor declares
exactly `fs-write`. The sandbox service therefore never routes a `network` or
`mask-paths` policy here, and the adaptor never has to silently drop a dimension it
cannot honor — for those, use the bubblewrap, Seatbelt or WSL backend for your platform.
Mounted beside one of those, it is used only where that backend is refused: the service
routes every policy to the backend implementing the most dimensions.

The chain picks its rung when the adaptor loads, and the settings card names the rung that
serves (`Landlock`, with `(partial)` on an older Landlock ABI). On Linux that runs the chain's
probes, so a host where neither rung works fails the load with DSH's reason rather than
mounting a backend that refuses every command; macOS and Windows have one rung each, which DSH
selects without probing.

What every rung leaves open, disclosed on the card under what the machine enforces:

- **The Session scratchpad is not writable** under Workspace Write. DSH's policy takes the
  Workspace alone, so commands cannot write the plan, goal or attachment files kept there.
- **The temporary directory cannot be closed.** Every rung grants one under Workspace Write;
  Landlock grants the host's shared `/tmp`. The adaptor does not declare `closed-temp`, so the
  card greys out turning **Temporary directory writable** off, and a policy turning it off is
  never routed here.
- **Landlock (partial)**: on a kernel older than Landlock ABI 5 (Linux 6.10; Ubuntu 24.04's
  6.8 has ABI 4), ioctl on device files outside the Workspace is not restricted, and below ABI 3
  (Linux 6.2) neither is truncating a file. The launcher reports this on every run; the harness
  drops that line from the command's stderr.

On Linux this is the floor the Sandbox card installs beside bubblewrap. Ubuntu 23.10 and later
restrict unprivileged user namespaces to AppArmor-profiled programs, which refuses bubblewrap
on an install that could not add a profile; Landlock needs neither a namespace nor root, so file
writes stay confined there with no host step.

## Windows: run command sessions under PowerShell

The ACL restricted-token runner does not start bash, and bash is the harness's default
session shell on Windows (Git for Windows, or the MinGit the Windows package bundles). A bare
`bash` reaches System32's WSL launcher; an MSYS `bash.exe` or `sh.exe` aborts under the
restricted token. So with this backend confining commands on Windows, set the session shell
in the harness's environment and restart it:

| Shell | Under the ACL runner | Setting |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PowerShell 7 (`pwsh`) | runs confined | `ADELIE_SHELL=pwsh` |
| Windows PowerShell 5.1 | runs confined | `ADELIE_SHELL=powershell` — for hosts without PowerShell 7; it ships with Windows |
| bash / sh (Git for Windows, MinGit) | does not start | — |
| Any other MSYS-runtime program (zsh, dash, `git-bash.exe`, anything in an MSYS2 or Git for Windows `usr\bin`) | refused | — |

Measured on GitHub's `windows-latest` (Windows Server 2025, pwsh 7.6.6, Windows PowerShell
5.1.26100): a write inside the Workspace lands and a write outside it is denied. `cmd` also
starts under the runner; it is not measured beyond that. The abort comes from the MSYS runtime
(`msys-2.0.dll`) that Git for Windows and MSYS2 share, not from bash itself, so the backend
refuses the other POSIX shells those distributions ship and every program in their `usr\bin`
the same way.

Until the shell is set, the backend's load fails with a reason naming these settings, so it is
not mounted: the Session view lists `dsh-local` among the unavailable backends with that
reason, and the composer marks the confining tier unavailable instead of offering a tier whose
every command would be refused. A harness whose core does not report its session shell (an
older runtime) loads the backend as before.

Each confined command is still checked on its own. A bash, sh or other MSYS-runtime program is
refused before it reaches the runner: when it is the session shell, the error names the same
settings; when it is something else — a stdio MCP Server launched through bash, which
`ADELIE_SHELL` does not choose — the error says only that the runner cannot start an
MSYS-runtime program. Nothing here changes on Linux or macOS, where bash runs confined as usual.

## Requirements

- The DSH dependencies (`@deepseek-ai/cordis`, `@deepseek-ai/dsh-sandbox`,
  `@deepseek-ai/dsh-sandbox-local`) are dependencies of **this package**, not of the
  harness — which is what "plugins are configuration, not built-in capability" means in
  dependency terms.

They load behind dynamic imports, which is load-bearing for hot push: the package reaches
native-adjacent modules that a pushed single-file bundle resolves from the installation, so
an installation missing them fails *this* load — reported fail-closed by the service —
instead of failing the whole platform bundle's import.

## Install

It ships with the harness build. On the Plugins page, install it to the Project that should
run it: the App re-assembles itself, no restart. Written by hand, it is a row of the Project's
`.project_config.toml`:

```toml
[plugins]
"@lmliheng/penguin-plugin-sandbox-dsh" = "*"
```

Installing is an operator-side action: the harness resolves the package from the installation,
never from this listing.
