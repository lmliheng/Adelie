# DeepSeek Harness sandbox adaptor

Puts the **DSH** sandbox ecosystem behind this harness's own sandbox interface. This is the
portable floor: it works on Linux, macOS and Windows, and implements the `fs-write`
dimension.

## What it covers

`@deepseek-ai/dsh-sandbox-local` carries the platform chain and probes each rung
functionally:

| Host | Mechanism |
| --- | --- |
| Linux | dsh-bwrap → Landlock |
| macOS | Seatbelt |
| Windows | ACL restricted-token runner |

DSH's policy vocabulary governs **file-write effects only**, so this adaptor declares
exactly `fs-write`. The sandbox service therefore never routes a `network` or
`mask-paths` policy here, and the adaptor never has to silently drop a dimension it
cannot honor — for those, use the bubblewrap, Seatbelt or WSL backend for your platform.

## Windows: run command sessions under PowerShell

The ACL restricted-token runner does not start bash, and bash is the harness's default
session shell on Windows (Git for Windows, or the MinGit the Windows package bundles). A bare
`bash` reaches System32's WSL launcher; an MSYS `bash.exe` or `sh.exe` aborts under the
restricted token. So with this backend confining commands on Windows, set the session shell
in the harness's environment and restart it:

| Shell | Under the ACL runner | Setting |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PowerShell 7 (`pwsh`) | runs confined | `ADELIE_SHELL=pwsh` |
| Windows PowerShell 5.1 | runs confined | `ADELIE_SHELL=powershell` — for hosts without PowerShell 7; it ships with Windows |
| bash / sh (Git for Windows, MinGit) | does not start | — |
| Any other MSYS-runtime program (zsh, dash, `git-bash.exe`, anything in an MSYS2 or Git for Windows `usr\bin`) | refused | — |

Measured on GitHub's `windows-latest` (Windows Server 2025, pwsh 7.6.6, Windows PowerShell
5.1.26100): a write inside the Workspace lands and a write outside it is denied. `cmd` also
starts under the runner; it is not measured beyond that. The abort comes from the MSYS runtime
(`msys-2.0.dll`) that Git for Windows and MSYS2 share, not from bash itself, so the backend
refuses the other POSIX shells those distributions ship and every program in their `usr\bin`
the same way.

Until the shell is set, the backend's load fails with a reason naming these settings, so it is
not mounted: the Session view lists `dsh-local` among the unavailable backends with that
reason, and the composer marks the confining tier unavailable instead of offering a tier whose
every command would be refused. A harness whose core does not report its session shell (an
older runtime) loads the backend as before.

Each confined command is still checked on its own. A bash, sh or other MSYS-runtime program is
refused before it reaches the runner: when it is the session shell, the error names the same
settings; when it is something else — a stdio MCP Server launched through bash, which
`ADELIE_SHELL` does not choose — the error says only that the runner cannot start an
MSYS-runtime program. Nothing here changes on Linux or macOS, where bash runs confined as usual.

## Requirements

- The DSH dependencies (`@deepseek-ai/cordis`, `@deepseek-ai/dsh-sandbox`,
  `@deepseek-ai/dsh-sandbox-local`) are dependencies of **this package**, not of the
  harness — which is what "plugins are configuration, not built-in capability" means in
  dependency terms.

They load behind dynamic imports, which is load-bearing for hot push: the package reaches
native-adjacent modules that a pushed single-file bundle resolves from the installation, so
an installation missing them fails *this* load — reported fail-closed by the service —
instead of failing the whole platform bundle's import.

## Install

It ships with the harness build. On the Plugins page, install it to the Project that should
run it: the App re-assembles itself, no restart. Written by hand, it is a row of the Project's
`.project_config.toml`:

```toml
[plugins]
"@lmliheng/penguin-plugin-sandbox-dsh" = "*"
```

Installing is an operator-side action: the harness resolves the package from the installation,
never from this listing.
