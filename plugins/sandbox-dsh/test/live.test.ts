/**
 * Live enforcement for the DSH adaptor against the real host: the real DSH chain

 *
 * Host-gated the way DSH gates its own backend e2e: one real confine decides
 * usability, and a host with no usable backend skips. The adaptor is driven DIRECTLY
 * (no SandboxService): what this package owes is that DSH's confinement works behind
 * our interface; routing and settings are the harness's behavior, tested there.
