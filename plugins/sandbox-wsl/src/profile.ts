/**
 * The pure half of the backend: how a Windows path is spelled inside the distro, which Linux
 * program a Windows argv names, and the bubblewrap profile one policy becomes. No process is
 * started here, so all of it is tested on any host.
 *
 * The profile, in order (bwrap applies mounts in order, and a later one shadows an earlier):
 *
 *   --die-with-parent --unshare-all [--share-net]     namespaces; the network only when allowed
 *   --ro-bind / /  (--bind / / under full access)     the distro itself
 *   --dev /dev --proc /proc
 *   --tmpfs /run                                      WSL's interop sockets are not reachable
 *   --ro-bind-try /run/resolvconf/resolv.conf …       … but name resolution still is (see below)
 *   [writable temp]      --tmpfs /tmp
 *   [confining modes]    --tmpfs /mnt                 every Windows drive hidden …
 *   [exposeWindowsDrives]  --ro-bind /mnt/<d> …       … or shown read-only
 *   [workspace]          --bind | --ro-bind <ws>      the Workspace, at its own /mnt path
 *   [writable roots]     --bind <root> <root>…         the policy's further roots (the scratchpad)
 *   --ro-bind-try /mnt/wsl/resolv.conf …              the file /etc/resolv.conf points at
 *   --remount-ro /mnt                                 the covering tmpfs itself is read-only
 *   [mask-paths]         --tmpfs <dir> | --ro-bind /dev/null <file>
 *
 * Why /mnt is hidden rather than left read-only: under WSL the whole Windows profile arrives at
 * /mnt/c/Users/<name>, credentials and browser data included. A policy that says "write the
 * Workspace" never meant "read the rest of the person's disk", and on Linux the equivalent
 * files belong to the host, not to a mount the distro adds. The setting that shows them
 * read-only exists for a toolchain that has to read something outside the Workspace.
 *
 * Why the tmpfs is remounted read-only: a tmpfs is writable, and bwrap creates the Workspace's
 * parent directories inside it. A write to `/mnt/c/Users/anything` therefore SUCCEEDED, in a
 * file that existed only for that one command and never reached Windows — a denial reported as
 * success, which is worse than a denial. Remounting after the binds makes the covering mount
 * refuse writes (EROFS) while the Workspace bound under it stays writable.
 *
 * Why resolv.conf is bound back: WSL keeps the generated one outside the distro's own root
 * (/mnt/wsl/resolv.conf, or /run/resolvconf/resolv.conf), and /etc/resolv.conf is a symlink to
 * it. Covering /mnt and /run therefore took DNS away — every name failed to resolve while the
 * network itself was reachable. The two candidates are bound back read-only; `-try` because a
 * distro uses one of them, not both.
