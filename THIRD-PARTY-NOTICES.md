# Third-party notices

PenguinHarness itself is licensed under Apache-2.0 (see [LICENSE](LICENSE)). Some **distributed
release artifacts** additionally bundle third-party programs and files, which keep their own
licenses. This file records those, and how to obtain their source.

The MiSans font files committed to this repository under `packages/ui/src/fonts/misans/` are not
covered by its Apache-2.0 license; like every other work listed here, they keep their own. The
programs below are downloaded by the release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) and placed
alongside the application inside the release archives. The fonts are part of the built web assets:
the build takes the MiSans files from this repository and copies every other font out of an npm
dependency. The web assets ship wherever the Web App does, and that includes npm:
`@lmliheng/penguin-cli` depends on `@lmliheng/penguin-server`, whose package carries them as
`web-dist/`. Installing from npm therefore bundles the fonts, but none of those programs.

What earns an entry is a third-party work redistributed **as its own file**, or third-party code
**adapted into this repository's own source**, whose license asks for its notice to go with every
copy; the last section lists that code. An npm package whose JavaScript is compiled and minified
into the application bundle (React, Shiki, xterm.js, KaTeX's own code, ...) is not listed: its
license travels with it in `node_modules` and in the lockfile, and repeating every one of them here
would be a second, staler copy of `pnpm-lock.yaml`.

## Node.js runtime — `node/`

Present in every archive except `penguin-universal.tar.gz`. Downloaded unmodified from the
official distribution at <https://nodejs.org/dist/>. Node.js is MIT-licensed with additional
notices for its dependencies; the full text ships inside the bundle
(`node/LICENSE`, and on Windows `node/LICENSE`).

Source: <https://github.com/nodejs/node> — the tag matching the bundled version, which is pinned
as `NODE_RUNTIME_VERSION` in the release workflow.

## MinGit (Git for Windows) — `git/`

Present in `penguin-win32-x64.zip` only.

The Windows package bundles **MinGit**, the minimal redistributable build of Git for Windows,
unmodified, as published by the Git for Windows project. It supplies the POSIX shell that the
agent's `exec_command` runs (`git/usr/bin/sh.exe`, which is GNU bash), roughly sixty core
utilities, and `git.exe`. It is used only when the machine has no Git for Windows installation of
its own; a user-installed one always takes precedence.

**License: GNU General Public License version 2** (with the additional per-component licenses
that Git for Windows ships). The complete license texts are included inside the bundle at
`git/LICENSE.txt` and `git/mingw64/share/licenses/`.

Version bundled: the release attached to the Git for Windows tag pinned as `MINGIT_TAG` in the
release workflow.

**Written offer / source availability.** The complete corresponding source code for the bundled
MinGit is published by the Git for Windows project at:

- <https://github.com/git-for-windows/git> — repository, tagged per release
- <https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases> — release assets, including the source
  archives for each tag

The bundled binaries are byte-identical to the `MinGit-<version>-64-bit.zip` asset of that tag;
no patches are applied. If you need the corresponding source and cannot obtain it from the URLs
above, open an issue on this repository and we will provide it.

## KaTeX fonts — `KaTeX_*.woff2` in the web assets

Present wherever the Web App ships: every release archive, the desktop application, the assets the
server serves, and the npm server package's `web-dist/`.

Math rendering uses [KaTeX](https://katex.org), whose typefaces are separate font files rather than
code. The web build copies them unmodified out of the `katex` npm package into the application's
asset directory, where the browser fetches them by URL; bundling them locally is what lets the
desktop application render formulas with no network. Only the woff2 format is copied — the woff and
truetype fallbacks KaTeX also ships are dropped at build time (`dropNonWoff2FontSources` in
`packages/web/vite.config.ts`).

**License: MIT**, the same license as the rest of KaTeX. The full text ships inside the package, at
`node_modules/katex/LICENSE`.

Source: <https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX> — the tag matching the `katex` version resolved in
`pnpm-lock.yaml`. The font sources and the script that builds them live in that repository.

## Mona Sans fonts — `mona-sans-*.woff2` in the web assets

Present wherever the Web App ships: every release archive, the desktop application, the assets the
server serves, and the npm server package's `web-dist/`.

Mona Sans Variable, latin and latin-ext. The web build copies the files unmodified out of the
`@fontsource-variable/mona-sans` npm package.

**License: SIL Open Font License 1.1.** The full text ships in every build as
`fonts-licenses/mona-sans.txt`, mirrored from the package's `LICENSE` into
`packages/ui/src/fonts/LICENSES/mona-sans.txt`.

Source: <https://fontsource.org/fonts/mona-sans> — the `@fontsource-variable/mona-sans` version
resolved in `pnpm-lock.yaml`.

## JetBrains Mono fonts — `jetbrains-mono-*.woff2` in the web assets

Present wherever the Web App ships: every release archive, the desktop application, the assets the
server serves, and the npm server package's `web-dist/`.

JetBrains Mono Variable, latin and latin-ext. The web build copies the files unmodified out of the
`@fontsource-variable/jetbrains-mono` npm package.

**License: SIL Open Font License 1.1.** The full text ships in every build as
`fonts-licenses/jetbrains-mono.txt`, mirrored from the package's `LICENSE` into
`packages/ui/src/fonts/LICENSES/jetbrains-mono.txt`.

Source: <https://fontsource.org/fonts/jetbrains-mono> — the `@fontsource-variable/jetbrains-mono`
version resolved in `pnpm-lock.yaml`.

## IBM Plex Sans fonts — `ibm-plex-sans-latin*.woff2` in the web assets

Present wherever the Web App ships: every release archive, the desktop application, the assets the
server serves, and the npm server package's `web-dist/`.

IBM Plex Sans Variable, latin and latin-ext. The web build copies the files unmodified out of the
`@fontsource-variable/ibm-plex-sans` npm package.

**License: SIL Open Font License 1.1.** The full text ships in every build as
`fonts-licenses/ibm-plex-sans.txt`, mirrored from the package's `LICENSE` into
`packages/ui/src/fonts/LICENSES/ibm-plex-sans.txt`.

Source: <https://fontsource.org/fonts/ibm-plex-sans> — the `@fontsource-variable/ibm-plex-sans`
version resolved in `pnpm-lock.yaml`.

## IBM Plex Sans Condensed fonts — `ibm-plex-sans-condensed-*.woff2` in the web assets

Present wherever the Web App ships: every release archive, the desktop application, the assets the
server serves, and the npm server package's `web-dist/`.

IBM Plex Sans Condensed at weight 600, latin and latin-ext. The web build copies the files
unmodified out of the `@fontsource/ibm-plex-sans-condensed` npm package.

**License: SIL Open Font License 1.1.** The full text ships in every build as
`fonts-licenses/ibm-plex-sans-condensed.txt`, mirrored from the package's `LICENSE` into
`packages/ui/src/fonts/LICENSES/ibm-plex-sans-condensed.txt`.

Source: <https://fontsource.org/fonts/ibm-plex-sans-condensed> — the
`@fontsource/ibm-plex-sans-condensed` version resolved in `pnpm-lock.yaml`.

## Noto Sans SC fonts — `noto-sans-sc-*.woff2` in the web assets

Present wherever the Web App ships: every release archive, the desktop application, the assets the
server serves, and the npm server package's `web-dist/`.

Noto Sans SC Variable, as the 101 `unicode-range` slices of the package's own stylesheet. The web
build copies the files unmodified out of the `@fontsource-variable/noto-sans-sc` npm package.

**License: SIL Open Font License 1.1.** The full text ships in every build as
`fonts-licenses/noto-sans-sc.txt`, mirrored from the package's `LICENSE` into
`packages/ui/src/fonts/LICENSES/noto-sans-sc.txt`.

Source: <https://fontsource.org/fonts/noto-sans-sc> — the `@fontsource-variable/noto-sans-sc`
version resolved in `pnpm-lock.yaml`.

## MiSans fonts — `misans-*.woff2` in the web assets

Present wherever the Web App ships: every release archive, the desktop application, the assets the
server serves, and the npm server package's `web-dist/`. The files are also committed to this
repository, under `packages/ui/src/fonts/misans/`.

[MiSans](https://hyperos.mi.com/font/) is a typeface licensed by Xiaomi Inc. (小米科技有限责任公司).
The Frost theme sets its Latin and Chinese text in MiSans Regular (400) and Medium (500), and only a
browser showing that theme loads them. `packages/ui/scripts/build-misans.py` subsets the two faces
from Xiaomi's official package into `unicode-range` WOFF2 slices: glyph outlines, metrics, OpenType
features and name records are kept, the tables that index glyphs are rebuilt for each slice's
smaller glyph set, and the DSIG table is dropped. The slices are distributed only as part of the
application, in its source tree, its builds and its npm package, and are never offered on their
own. The application states that it uses MiSans on the Credits page of the Web App's settings
(Settings → Credits / 设置 → 版权信息), which names every bundled font with its licence
(condition 1 of the Agreement).

Every slice keeps the copyright notice of the font files:

Copyright © 2020-2025 Beijing Xiaomi Mobile Software Co.,Ltd. All Rights Reserved.

**License: MiSans Font Intellectual Property License Agreement (MiSans 字体知识产权许可协议).** The
full text, in Chinese and English, ships beside the fonts in every build as
`fonts-licenses/misans.txt`, so every copy keeps both the copyright notice and the Agreement
(condition 4). The canonical copy of the text is `packages/ui/src/fonts/LICENSES/misans.txt`,
transcribed from the licensor's PDF; the text below repeats it, and the two must be updated
together.

## GenericAgent — the built-in browser's page scripts

Adapted into this repository's source, so present wherever the server ships: every release archive,
the desktop application, and the `@lmliheng/penguin-server` npm package.

The built-in browser's page scripts under `packages/server/src/builtin-browser/page-scripts/` (the
DOM simplification that `penguin browser scan` returns, and the change monitor behind
`penguin browser exec`) are ported from GenericAgent's `simphtml.py`; each ported file says so at
its top. The `penguin browser` commands and the `browser-automation` skill follow GenericAgent's
`web_scan` / `web_execute_js` tools and its browser operating notes.
