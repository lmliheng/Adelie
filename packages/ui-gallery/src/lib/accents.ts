/**
 * The accent choices the rail offers: the theme's own accent (随主题, stored as `neutral`, which
 * sets no `data-accent`) and the presets the ACTIVE theme lists. Each theme declares its own list
 * in the package (`ACCENT_PRESETS` in tokens.ts — Primer the five the Web App has always had,
 * Frost a warm set, Console terminal hues), and this file is the one place the gallery reads it,
 * so the rail, the URL and the resolution agree on what a preset is.
 *
 * A chosen preset outlives the theme that listed it: it stays in the URL and in memory and goes
 * onto the root as it is — a theme's preset rules match only their own theme, so under a theme
 * that does not list it the theme's own accent shows, and the preset comes back when the reader
 * returns to a theme that does. So switching themes to look at something never loses a choice,
 * and a link with `accent=amber` means the same thing whichever theme it opens on.
