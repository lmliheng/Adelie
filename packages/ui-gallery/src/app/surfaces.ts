/**
 * The app's surfaces: what the gallery frames, one page each (`/s/<id>`), grouped the way the
 * index and the left nav list them. A surface is a route of the real Web App plus how the
 * frame opens it — signed in or out, and a dialog to open once it is up. The titles and
 * descriptions are chrome copy (`S.surfaces`), keyed by these ids.
 *
 * Pure data with no value imports, so Node can import this file as it is (the screenshot
 * script does): the ids the routes name are spelled here, and a test holds them to the demo
 * store's (src/app/mock/ids.ts).
