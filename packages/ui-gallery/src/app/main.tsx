/**
 * The framed app's entry (`app.html`): the real Web App, mounted on an in-memory router at the
 * route the URL names, against the demo store in the language the URL names. The document's
 * storage was already replaced and seeded by the inline script in the page head, and the app's
 * own boot script has applied the theme, so by the time this runs the app boots exactly as it
 * does for a user with those preferences.
 *
 * The app's own entry reconciles browser storage against the server's data root before
 * mounting; a frame's storage is fresh every load, so there is nothing to reconcile and the
 * app mounts at once. KaTeX's stylesheet comes with the shared UI package's Markdown (its prose
 * component imports it), as it does in the app.
 *
 * `open=settings` (or `settings.<page>`) asks the app for its Settings dialog through the
 * app's own request seam, which the account menu answers as soon as it mounts.
