/**
 * The framed component library's entry (`lib.html`): one topic's board, made of the Web App's
 * real components, mounted under the app's own providers — locale, theme, the toast overlay and
 * the tooltip layer — with the gallery's context for the boards that read tokens and the
 * gallery's dictionary. The document's storage was already replaced and seeded by the inline
 * script in the page head, and the app's own boot script has applied the theme, so the board
 * renders exactly as the app would.
 *
 * The mock network is installed as in the app frame: a component that fetches (the file
 * browser's preview, a chart) gets the demo store's answer. Code is highlighted by the app's own
 * worker-backed highlighter, handed to the package's code surfaces as the app hands it; KaTeX's
 * stylesheet comes with the package's Markdown.
