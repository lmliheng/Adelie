/**
 * The packed app carries a working `penguin`.
 *
 * Run after `electron-builder --dir` (CI's runtime job builds exactly that tree). An
 * installed desktop app puts the CLI on the user's PATH: the deb postinst links
 * /usr/bin/penguin at install time, and the other three forms install this same launcher
 * from the shell at launch (src/cli-install.ts). Every one of them resolves <app>/bin/penguin and
 * <app>/dist/penguin.js as plain files inside the packed tree, so `bin/` dropping out of
 * electron-builder's `files`, asar being switched on, or the bundled entry being renamed
 * would ship an app whose `penguin` command does not exist — with nothing else in the
 * build failing. The unit tests pin those couplings in the config files; this checks the
 * tree they produced.
 *
 * Every app directory found is checked for the launchers and the bundled entry. The
 * launcher is then actually run: a cross-architecture bundle that cannot execute on this
 * host is reported and skipped, but at least one has to run and report a version.
