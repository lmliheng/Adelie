/**
 * Five self-contained bundles, no shared chunks: the shell itself, the server it forks as a
 * utilityProcess, the CLI its bin/ launchers start on the app's Electron runtime, and the two
 * modules scripts/build-assets.mjs imports (plain node, no Electron) to produce the rest of
 * the build — launcher.ts writes the launcher scripts, pty-payload.ts stages node-pty.
 *
 * The server and the CLI are bundled from their own packages' build output, so the app runs
 * exactly what an `npm install` of those packages would, linked into one file each.
 *
 * Bundling absorbs every JavaScript dependency, so the app carries no JavaScript dependency
 * tree. Two things cannot be absorbed: node-pty, a native module the server reaches through a
 * runtime `require` whose loader resolves the binary relative to its own package directory —
 * build-assets.mjs stages a package directory for it at dist/node_modules/node-pty (see
 * src/pty-payload.ts) — and the @lmliheng/* plugin packages, data directories the
 * bundled core loader resolves by package name from the bundle's own location, which travel
 * as this package's declared dependencies (electron-builder collects them, pnpm links them).
