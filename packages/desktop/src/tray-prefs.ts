/**
 * The tray preferences — on disk, and on the wire. Pure path, file and frame logic, no
 * Electron imports (unit-tested).
 *
 * Two booleans live in `userData/tray.json`:
 *
 * - `showTrayIcon` — whether the app keeps an icon in the system tray at all. It is the
 *   Web App's Settings › Appearance switch, relayed to the shell over the utilityProcess
 *   message channel the client updater already uses (see main.ts and the server's
 *   services/desktop-update-port.ts).
 * - `closeToTray` — whether closing the main window hides it into the tray instead of
 *   following the platform's default close semantics. It is the tray menu's own checkbox.
 *
 * and one language:
 *
 * - `locale` — the Web App's UI language, reported over the same channel, so the tray menu
 *   reads the way the window does. The shell cannot see that preference itself: it lives in
 *   the browser's localStorage. Null until a page has reported one, and after that it is kept
 *   so a fresh launch draws the right menu before any window has finished loading.
 *
 * Both are conveniences, never a reason for the shell to fail to start — a missing or
 * malformed file reads as the defaults (both on), and a failed write is the caller's line
 * in the log.
