/**
 * macOS folder access: the shell's half of the Workspace picker's "Allow access" (pure apart
 * from the injected deps, so it unit-tests without Electron).
 *
 * macOS privacy protection (TCC) asks the user about Desktop, Documents, Downloads and
 * removable or network volumes only on behalf of an app it holds responsible for the read, and
 * lists under Files and Folders only the apps it has asked about; any other read gets a silent
 * EPERM, with nothing for the user to allow. A read from the embedded server has been seen to
 * fail that way without a prompt, so the server relays the page's request here and the main
 * process reads the folder itself, once, in the app's own name. Once the app is allowed, its
 * children — the server and the agents' shells — read too. A development instance started from
 * a terminal is that terminal's responsibility instead, whatever the app declares, so the reply
 * says whether the app is packaged and the page words its advice accordingly.
 *
 * The second request opens the Privacy & Security pane the page names. Mechanism only (see
 * main.ts's header): what an outcome means for the user is the page's to say.
 *
 * The wire is the server's api contract, imported type-only.
