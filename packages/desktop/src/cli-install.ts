/**
 * The `penguin` command an installed desktop app provides: PATH exposure for the bundled
 * CLI launcher (`<app>/bin/penguin`, generated at stage time; see launcher.ts).
 *
 * It installs itself, at every launch, without asking — the CLI is part of what the app
 * is, and an update that left a stale command behind would point an old client at a new
 * server. Per platform (deb is absent on purpose: its postinst ships /usr/bin/penguin, see
 * build/linux/after-install.tpl):
 * - macOS: symlink /usr/local/bin/penguin → <app>/bin/penguin. The unprivileged write is
 *   tried first and an administrator prompt appears only where it actually fails, which on
 *   a Mac without Homebrew is where /usr/local/bin has to be created.
 * - Windows: append <app>\bin to the user PATH (HKCU\Environment) via reg.exe, idempotently
 *   and append-only; new terminals pick it up. No elevation is involved.
 * - Linux AppImage: write an executable ~/.local/bin/penguin wrapper that runs the AppImage
 *   itself as Node (see launcher.ts appImageWrapperScript).
 *
 * Two rules follow from doing this silently, both enforced in cli-link.ts:
 * - A `penguin` this app did not write is never replaced. `install.sh` puts its own symlink
 *   at the very path the AppImage form uses, and the user may have one from anywhere else.
 *   Such a target is skipped and the reason recorded.
 * - Nothing is installed from a location that will not persist — a macOS bundle still on
 *   its dmg, or one Gatekeeper is running translocated — because the link would dangle the
 *   moment the mount goes away. The next launch from /Applications installs it.
 *
 * Everything is native UI (menu item + dialogs) in English: the main process stays outside
 * the web app's i18n, and per the design the desktop shell talks to the page only through
 * the server's HTTP API — never a private IPC channel.
