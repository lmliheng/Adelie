/**
 * Desktop shell main process.
 *
 * HMR LAYER — MECHANISM ONLY (see packages/hmr/README.md). The
 * shell boots and hosts; it does not implement product behavior. It is also
 * the least updatable code in the system — a change here reaches users only
 * through a new installer — so a capability that could instead be delivered
 * by a platform push must be. A rejected example: adding a preload bridge so
 * the web UI could open DevTools, when the shell's own View menu already
 * does it.
 *
 * One window over the embedded server: fork penguin-server as a utilityProcess on the
 * shared data root (PENGUIN_HOME or ~/.penguin/data), learn its port (last launch's when
 * still free, so origin-scoped localStorage preferences survive restarts), and load
 * `http://localhost:<port>/api/auth/claim?token=…` — the one-shot token lands
 * the window signed in as admin. The window is a plain browser environment (no preload,
 * no node integration); every capability flows through the server's HTTP API.
 *
 * Attach mode: when a live server (e.g. `penguin web`) already owns the data root, the
 * window loads that instance instead. The one-shot token buys nothing there, so the shell
 * signs the window in the other way it is entitled to — a session minted straight into the
 * data root it owns (see attach-session.ts) — and the same move answers any later arrival at
 * the sign-in page, which has no password anyone could type. Signing out is the exception:
 * it is a decision rather than a failure, so it is left to stand until the next sign-in or
 * the next launch.
 *
 * Tray: a system-tray icon is shown for as long as the app runs, and by default closing the
 * window only hides it, so the server and its background tasks keep running (see tray.ts;
 * both preferences live in userData/tray.json and Quit still goes through the graceful
 * stop). Settings › Appearance turns the icon off and on, reaching the shell over the same
 * utilityProcess relay the client updater uses.
 *
 * Built-in browser: the main window (and no other) may host <webview> guests in the
 * `persist:penguin-browser` partition, and builtin-browser.ts relays raw CDP and cookie writes
 * for them over that same port. That relay is the only part of the browser the shell carries,
 * and it lives here because it has to: a guest's `webContents.debugger` and the partition's
 * session are main-process APIs that neither the page nor the server process can reach. The
 * tab registry, the page scripts, scan / exec / click, import and history are the server
 * platform's, delivered by push like any other product behavior.
 *
 * Folder access (macOS): on the Workspace picker's request, relayed over the same port, the
 * main process reads a protected folder once and opens System Settings at a privacy pane (see
 * folder-access.ts). It lives here because it has to: macOS asks about Desktop, Documents and
 * Downloads only on behalf of the app it holds responsible, and the app is this process. What
 * to tell the user about the outcome is the Web App's.
 *
 * Dev isolation: the dev profile — an unpackaged run, or any build launched with `--dev`
 * — takes a dev-suffixed identity (own userData, and with it the single-instance lock and
 * sticky port) and defaults to the ~/.penguin/dev-data root, so it runs beside an
 * installed release build (see app-identity.ts). Updating and the per-launch CLI link
 * repair stay with the release profile: both touch the one installation the two
 * instances share.
 *
 * Smoke hook (PENGUIN_DESKTOP_SMOKE=1): after the first load settles, print a
 * `DESKTOP-SMOKE-RESULT {json}` line (+ screenshot when PENGUIN_DESKTOP_SMOKE_SHOT is
 * set) and quit through the regular quit path, exercising the graceful server stop.
