 * here: the desktop seeds its admin with a random password that is hashed and discarded
 * unseen, so there is nothing to type and nothing to look up.
 *
 * The way out is the authorization the shell already holds. Being able to read and write a
 * data root is this product's authorization boundary — that directory holds every credential
 * a session could reach — so the shell mints a session row in the root's own web.db and hands
 * the window the cookie for it, the same move `penguin auth token` makes for a script. A root
 * it cannot mint in says so in one of a few recognizable ways, and each of them is something
 * the person at the keyboard can act on, so the failures come back as text for a dialog
 * rather than as an exception.
 *
 * Pure, and free of Electron: the minter is a parameter, so the tests drive every outcome.
