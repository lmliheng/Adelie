/**
 * The plugin import flows' pure half (features/plugins/plugin-import): the client-side size
 * guard, the optional plugin-name field, the name a failed import is about, and the code → copy
 * mapping.
 *
 * What matters is agreement with the SERVER rather than these functions' own arithmetic. The
 * size guard exists only to save a user a pointless upload, so it must draw the line exactly
 * where the server does (`>` the cap, not `>=`) — a stricter client silently blocks a legal
 * file, a looser one replaces a clear refusal with a 413 after a long base64 upload. The name
 * field is the same kind of agreement on a different rule: what it holds back is a request the
 * server would answer 400 for, and what it must NOT hold back is the empty field, which is how
 * the archive gets to name the plugin. The name and the message both feed a confirmation the
 * user reads before overwriting a plugin directory, so a miss there either names the wrong
 * plugin or asks in English.
