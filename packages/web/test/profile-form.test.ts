 * profile-form.ts: what the Profile page's nickname buttons write, and when they are live.

 * The page's other half — a picked image applying without a Save — is a React effect of the
 * pick handler and this package's vitest is node-only (`environment: "node"`, no jsdom), so it
 * is not reachable from here; what IS reachable is the rule that decides the two nickname
 * writes, which is the half a regression would land on silently.
