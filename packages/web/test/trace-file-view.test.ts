/**
 * The Trace file view as drawn (features/traces/trace-file-view.tsx, `TraceFileBody`): what a
 * long file puts on screen once its analysis is in and its newest round is read. Rendered to
 * static markup, so each scenario hands the view the state it would hold.
 *
 * - A 1200-round file draws at most 50 round heads, and the rows of exactly one round — the
 *   open newest one.
 * - The rounds not drawn sit behind an "earlier rounds" control that names how many there are;
 *   one step draws 50 more; a file of fewer than 50 rounds has no such control.
 * - A collapsed round draws no rows, even when its events are held from an earlier opening.
 * - An open round whose read is still out draws a placeholder and no rows; one whose read
 *   failed says so in place of its rows.
 * - Each round's context ring is bounded by the file's context window, and by 128k when the
 *   analysis (from an older server) carries none.
 * - Opening a file asks once to scroll its newest round into view — the open round drawn last —
 *   and no refresh after it asks again, not even one that opens a new round for a reader
 *   following the run.
