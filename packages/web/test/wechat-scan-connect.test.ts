/**
 * The WeChat scan-to-connect block (features/messaging/wechat-scan-connect.tsx): what it
 * renders, and the decision its poll loop makes on each answer (`wechatScanStep`, tested by
 * value). The QR itself is QQ's component and is tested there.
 *
 * - The scan is offered as a control alone, its explanation disclosed elsewhere, and nothing is
 *   requested before the user asks; with a credential stored it offers to replace it; it is
 *   gated, with the reason, while the connection is enabled.
 * - The loop keeps waiting while nothing has happened, reports scanning and pairing progress
 *   without taking the code down, hands the binding on so the editor adopts it without a second
 *   GET, ends on a spent pairing code, reports an already-bound bot as news rather than as a
 *   failure, rides out a transient failure, and replaces a lapsed code a bounded number of times.
