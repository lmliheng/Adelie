/**
 * The cost center's controls and series shaping (features/usage/usage-controls.ts).
 *
 * - A calendar preset ends today and spans its day count inclusively; a trailing preset yields
 *   instant bounds plus the local dates they span; a range counts both ends.
 * - The range picks the precision: one per preset, a custom range scaling day → week → month,
 *   never more buckets than the server returns, timestamp precisions only for trailing presets.
 * - A bucket key reads short on the axis and in full in the bubble.
 * - The requests chart keeps its top entities and folds a tail of two or more into one summed,
 *   counted tail (success counts included); a tail of one keeps its name; by default every named
 *   series fits the palette.
 * - Series sum column by column; a bucket with nothing to rate has no rate (neither 0 nor a
 *   number), and is drawn at the top of the percent axis only so a line can cross it.
 * - Empty buckets are dropped (a request with no tokens still counts), shortening the axis and
 *   marking breaks where buckets were skipped; per-entity counts stay with their buckets.
