/**
 * A company's channel list (features/company/channel-list.ts).
 *
 * - The all-hands channel renders under its localized label; every other channel under its
 *   stored name.
 * - A new channel id follows the server's semantic-id grammar; a blank, malformed, reserved or
 *   taken id is refused with its reason before the request goes out.
 * - The list pins the all-hands channel, then splits the rest into mine and others, with
 *   archived channels folded away whatever the membership; each run is ordered by name, then
 *   id, and a missing all-hands channel is survived.
 * - The badges sum unread messages and mentions over the joined, unarchived channels only.
 * - Invite candidates are the employees then the Project members not already in the channel,
 *   with an employee's title as detail, a prefix match ranked above a substring match.
