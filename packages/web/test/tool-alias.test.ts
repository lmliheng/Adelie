/**
 * A tool call's display name (lib/tool-alias.ts).
 *
 * - With the switch on, every built-in tool of core's registry reads as a short name of its
 *   own, in either language.
 * - An MCP tool and the names only older Traces carry pass through untouched.
 * - With the switch off, every name comes back exactly as it came in.
 * - Both dictionaries alias exactly core's built-in tools, so registering a new built-in tool
 *   without a short name fails here instead of shipping a card that reads as the wire name.
