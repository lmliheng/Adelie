/**
 * The scheduled-tasks store (features/schedules/schedule-store.ts), which the session list's
 * marks and the dock's scheduled-tasks panel both read: one list per PROJECT (every Agent's
 * tasks in a single answer), so a row's mark never depends on which Agent is current. Driven
 * through the real `listProjectSchedules` against the fetch fake; each test uses its own
 * Project ids, so the module-level cache needs no reset.
 *
 * - Each Project keeps its own list, and a Project never answered reads as nothing.
 * - A Project asked for while another's read is out gets its own request, and each answer
 *   lands in its own Project's entry, whatever order they arrive in.
 * - One request per Project is shared while it is out; once settled, the next refresh asks again.
 * - A failure is confined to the Project that failed.
 * - A schedule event re-reads a Project only while a reader is mounted on it (readers are
 *   counted, so one surface unmounting does not silence the other), and never one nobody asked
 *   about.
 * - The session list marks the Sessions of every Agent out of one answer.
