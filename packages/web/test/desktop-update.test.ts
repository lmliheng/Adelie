/**
 * desktop-update.ts unit tests: who gets the client update surface at all, and when an
 * armed row-initiated check settles (one report per outcome — in the modal when it is
 * open, a toast otherwise).
 *
 * offersClientUpdate is pinned in all four combinations for the same reason as
 * offersChangePassword next door: each single-field simplification fails a real case —
 * `desktopMode` alone offers a remote browser a button that restarts someone else's
 * GUI app, `sessionVia` alone offers it to a stale desktop cookie replayed against a
 * plain server with no shell listening. vitest runs node-only here, so this asserts
 * the pure helpers, not a rendered row (account-menu.test.ts convention).
