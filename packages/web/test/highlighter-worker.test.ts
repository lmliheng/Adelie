/**
 * Highlighting must stay off the main thread, and the engine must stay out of the main bundle.
 *
 * Tokenizing is linear in the size of the input and runs to completion once it starts, so the
 * viewer's responsiveness depends on it happening in a worker. The engine lives in the shared UI
 * package on its own subpath (`@lmliheng/penguin-ui/highlighter`, which the package's code
 * surfaces never import — they ask the highlighter the app hands them), and the app decides where
 * it runs. Three edits would quietly undo that without failing a build or looking wrong in
 * review: calling the engine directly from a component, turning the client's fallback
 * `await import(…)` into a static import — which bundles a second ~147KB copy of Shiki into the
 * entry chunk for every reader whose worker works, the very cost the split exists to avoid — and
 * handing the code surfaces something other than the worker client.
 *
 * vitest runs node-only here (`environment: "node"`, no jsdom), so this asserts against the
 * source text rather than a running worker.
