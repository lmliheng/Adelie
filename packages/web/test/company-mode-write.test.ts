/**
 * The company-mode master switch in System settings › Server (features/settings/
 * company-mode-write.ts): it applies on the flip, so the write is the whole save path.
 *
 * - A flip either way sends that one field alone and settles on what the server answers, even
 *   when the server stored something other than what was asked.
 * - A failed write reverts the switch to the stored value (on stays on, off stays off) and
 *   carries the described reason.
