/**
 * Guard: every Markdown renderer in the Web App and the shared UI package uses the one shared
 * plugin pipeline (the UI package's prose/markdown-plugins.ts). A renderer that quietly dropped it
 * would still render Markdown, so no behaviour test fails; only its math and its URL boundaries go
 * wrong, on one surface. How the pipeline renders is the UI package's own suite
 * (packages/ui/test/prose-math.test.ts). The rule is held over every source file rather than a
 * list of known renderers, so a new renderer is covered the moment it is written.
 *
 * - Every `<ReactMarkdown>` is given both shared plugin lists, taken from the shared module (the
 *   package's own module inside the UI package, the package entry in the Web App).
 * - No source file imports the underlying remark/rehype plugins itself.
