/**
 * Guard: the icon family as the app uses it — the role-named scale, the registry and the
 * renderers, all in the shared UI package (`icon-scale.ts`, `components/icons/…`). A new inline
 * `<svg>` re-drawing a glyph the app already owns, at a stroke weight nobody chose, is what
 * decays, so these are source scans over the web app and the UI package.
 *
 * - The scan reads every source root and finds the icon modules in one place each; every icon
 *   rung is a whole pixel value in the legible range.
 * - Each shared glyph (the control caret, the close cross, the collapse chevron, the two dock
 *   marks, the memory brain, the background-task trace) is drawn in exactly one place.
 * - No literal stroke weight appears outside the ones the family chose.
 * - Every theme sets a line-family weight for `--ui-icon-stroke` in both modes, and the default
 *   theme keeps the weight GlyphIcon falls back to.
