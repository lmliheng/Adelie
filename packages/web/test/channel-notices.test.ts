/**
 * A channel's system lines in the reader's language (features/company/channel-notices.ts).
 *
 * - Every kind the contract declares has wording in both languages, even for a notice that is
 *   missing its parameters.
 * - A hire names its employees and keeps the job title verbatim.
 * - A member reads as its user id and an unknown employee as its id, never as a principal.
 * - A budget event carries its period, share and amounts; a ticket event its id and title.
 * - A kind this build does not know renders nothing, so the view falls back to the server's
 *   English text.
