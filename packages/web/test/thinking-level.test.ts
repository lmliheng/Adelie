/**
 * The thinking-level pickers (features/chat/thinking-level.ts) and the tier names in both
 * dictionaries.
 *
 * - The pickers offer exactly the tiers core accepts as a chat default; every stored level,
 *   a legacy "none" included, is named in both locales.
 * - The zh trigger shows a Chinese name with no wire value, while every menu row, in either
 *   language, shows the wire value once.
 * - A non-level ("" for no override, a legacy "default", an unknown value, nothing) has no
 *   label; a level missing from the name table shows its raw value.
 * - The draft picker resolves the Agent's explicit level, then the Project's chat default, then
 *   medium, the chain core applies.
 * - The Agent settings dropdown lists the dictionary's tiers without the inherit row, adding a
 *   display-only "none" row when the stored config holds one.
 * - The provider's prefix cache is at risk once there is history, unless the transcript ends in
 *   a successful compaction.
 * - A mid-chat pick asks for confirmation only when history exists and the pick differs from
 *   the displayed level (or that level is unknown), never right after a successful compaction.
 * - After "compact, then switch", the wait settles on the compaction started by that choice
 *   (completed, failed or still running), and the pick is applied once it settles, even when
 *   the compaction failed or never started.
 * - The in-session picker follows the Agent config until a level is pinned on the Session.
