/**
 * The QQ scan-to-connect block (features/messaging/qq-scan-connect.tsx): what it renders, and
 * the decision its poll loop makes on each answer (`qqScanStep`, tested by value).
 *
 * - The QR is generated locally and inlined as SVG (no image request can leak the task
 *   handle), with the spec's four-module quiet zone, dark-on-white in both themes.
 * - The scan is offered as a control alone, its explanation disclosed in the setup fold, and
 *   nothing is requested before the user asks; it is gated, with the reason, while the
 *   connection is enabled.
 * - The loop keeps waiting until the scan happens, hands the binding on so the editor adopts it
 *   without a second GET, rides out a transient failure (giving up, and releasing the task,
 *   only after repeated ones), and replaces a lapsed code a bounded number of times.
