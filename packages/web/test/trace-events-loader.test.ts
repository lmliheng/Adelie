/**
 * The Trace file view's event pager (features/traces/trace-events-loader.ts). The walk must
 * cover the WHOLE file: the analysis attributes messages to rounds by index range, so an event
 * never fetched is a round that renders an empty message list.
 *
 * - A 2500-event file is paged in three requests, every page reported in file order; the walk
 *   advances by what a page delivered, not by what it asked for.
 * - A file appended to while the walk runs is followed to its new end.
 * - The walk ends on a page with no events, however long the file claims to be; it reports and
 *   requests nothing more once cancelled (a page arriving after the cancel is dropped); a walk
 *   that never finishes is capped.
 * - It resolves with the last page's total, the walk's final word on the file's length.
