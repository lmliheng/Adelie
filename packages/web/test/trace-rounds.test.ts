/**
 * Which rounds the Trace panel draws and reads (features/traces/trace-rounds.ts). A long
 * Session's file is thousands of rounds and tens of megabytes; the panel stays fast only while
 * what it draws and what it reads are bounded by what the reader opened.
 *
 * - A 1200-round file draws its newest 50 round cards, oldest first; one "earlier" step draws
 *   the newest 100; a file shorter than a page draws all of it.
 * - Reading a round asks for its own index range only, in ceil(span / 1000) requests, and gets
 *   back exactly that range in file order; an empty round asks for nothing.
 * - A page answered short is followed from where it ended; a range that runs past the file's end
 *   or meets a page with no events stops instead of asking again; a cancelled read asks no more.
 * - Opening a file reads its newest round and nothing in any collapsed round.
 * - A refresh re-reads only the open rounds that grew; a collapsed round that grew is left
 *   alone until it is opened.
 * - A file opens on its newest round only; a refresh keeps the reader's choices, and a new round
 *   opens only when the reader was following the newest one.
