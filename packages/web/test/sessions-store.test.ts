/**
 * The sessions store's list (state/sessions.tsx), driven through the real `listSessions`
 * wrapper against the fetch fake: each server pages its own rows, counts are summed, and a
 * source that could not answer is never read as a source that answered nothing.
 *
 * Loading:
 * - A fresh store is loading, and a reload with no Agent set does not claim to be done.
 * - A refresh over rows already on screen does not raise loading.
 *
 * Several machines:
 * - Every source is merged newest first, each row remembers the machine it lives on, the
 *   counts are summed, and what a machine answered is cached for the next restart.
 * - A machine is asked about its own Agents too, and this server only about its own.
 * - One Agent this server cannot answer about keeps its rows and counts; the rest refresh.
 * - A 404 from a machine is an answer: its rows go and its cache is cleared.
 * - A machine that could not answer keeps its cached rows and its cache; counts come only
 *   from servers that answered.
 * - This server not answering abandons the reload: the rows stand and loading stays clear.
 * - Two machines' counts for one path stay apart.
 * - A group's next page is asked only of the machine the group is on, by path.
 *
 * The user's own rows only:
 * - Every fetch, a reload or a folder's next page, asks the server to leave the
 *   organizations' rows out of the page and the totals.
 * - An organization row that enters by another door is held for its page, survives reloads,
 *   and never moves the own-only totals; an own row added the same way still counts.
 *
 * Activity order and cursors:
 * - Every list fetch asks for the activity order; a first page sends no cursor, and the next
 *   continues below the last row shown (never the overflow row).
 * - A Workspace group's first own page continues from its Agent's whole-stream cursor on that
 *   machine; when that stream is exhausted, no request is sent.
 * - The watermark over two machines is the more recent cursor with more; a machine nothing was
 *   read from bounds nothing; everything exhausted shows every row.
 * - A folder pages in activity order too: an archived conversation resumed yesterday lists
 *   above one archived last month, and its next page continues below it.
 *
 * Sessions that become active:
 * - A loaded row moves up without a request.
 * - A Session of this Project no page holds is fetched from the machine that announced it and
 *   shows at the top; one run's flips share one lookup and the newest flip lands on the row.
 * - Another Project's flip, an organization's Session, an id deleted here and an id that is
 *   gone are not listed, and the last three are not asked about again.
 * - A reload that was already running when such a Session was fetched keeps it.
 *
 * Property (seeded, 100 runs): after any sequence of loads, live flips and reloads, every list
 * the sidebar draws — time mode's, each Agent group's, each Workspace group's — is a prefix of
 * its true activity order; a load only appends below what was shown, and a "More" over every
 * stream with more shows at least a page more (or the rest).
 *
 * Live statuses:
 * - A session_state for a Session no loaded page holds is remembered without inventing a
 *   row, the run's end included; a loaded row's own status wins over an older remembered one.
 * - A resync forgets the remembered statuses, and a held organization row does not stand in
 *   for them.
 *
 * Events from a machine:
 * - A session_created for this Project reloads wherever it happened; another Project's never.
