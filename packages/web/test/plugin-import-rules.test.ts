/**
 * The plugin rules panel (src/features/plugins/plugin-import-dialog.tsx), and the dialog it now
 * lives in rather than under the import dialogs' fields.
 *
 * It states, at the point where an operator is naming a plugin, the rules the form cannot show.
 * Two of them carry the weight: leave the name empty and it comes from the SOURCE — and a GitHub
 * repository URL carries the repository's name, which is how a plugin installs under a name
 * nobody asked for; and a plugin must not carry its author's account details or credentials, a
 * rule whose home is this surface rather than any one plugin repository.
 *
 * The dialogs themselves cannot be rendered here (Modal portals to document.body, this suite is
 * `environment: "node"`), so the panel is rendered on its own and the two dialogs are checked
 * against the source, the way modal-focus.test.ts checks its portal-bound wiring.
