/**
 * Owner-only writes are offered to the Project's owner alone. The server refuses three of them to
 * anyone else with 403 (`requireProjectOwner`): creating a Benchmark by hand
 * (`POST /api/projects/:projectId/benchmarks`), deleting one
 * (`DELETE /api/projects/:projectId/benchmarks/:benchmarkId`) and importing a Trace
 * (`POST /api/projects/:projectId/agents/:agentId/traces/import`). A member offered one could
 * only fill in the form, or pick the file, for a refusal at the end, and copy that names one of
 * these steps sends a member to a button they do not have.
 *
 * vitest runs node-only here, so the Evaluation Center's buttons and a failed Benchmark's notices
 * are rendered to static markup, and the Trace import row is checked through the function its
 * Project picker is derived from — the row draws nothing when that function offers no Project.
