/**
 * The overview page's shaping (features/company/overview-summary.ts).
 *
 * - Employees are counted by desk, running and budget-paused, live states overriding the
 *   snapshot where known; no employees count zero.
 * - The board lists every column in lifecycle order with its share; a missing column is zero
 *   and an empty board has no shares.
 * - Today's timeline orders instances by time (the last firing over the next), marks the
 *   unevaluated ones upcoming, and buckets the outcomes.
 * - Spend derives ratio and remainder from a budget (the server's ratio winning, overspend a
 *   negative remainder), and neither without a budget.
 * - The inbox orders rows newest first (undated last, ties by mention, blocked, done), says
 *   what each row is about and where it leads, dates a ticket by its close then its id's day,
 *   keeps the newest rows under the cap, and is empty for an older server.
 * - The filter chips count and admit rows by category.
 * - First steps: fresh while only the CEO is employed and the board is empty, the CEO first
 *   while the desk was never opened, and no next step once all three are done.
 * - The mission fold is offered for a mission with a line break or longer than a line.
