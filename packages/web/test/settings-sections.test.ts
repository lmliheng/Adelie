/**
 * Which Settings pages each viewer gets (lib/settings-sections.ts), pinned by value: a rail
 * showing a forbidden entry leaks that the setting exists, and a page rendered without the same
 * filter hands a non-admin the form. The admin APIs answer a non-admin with 403 either way; this
 * filter is convenience, not the boundary.
 *
 * - A web admin gets every page in rail order; a non-admin only their own pages, nothing
 *   server-global; the desktop shell's window drops the account page and user management; a
 *   password session against a desktop-mode server keeps the account page.
 * - The rail lists an admin's groups once each, in page order, and a single group when only
 *   one remains (its cue to draw no heading).
 * - A requested page passes through when the viewer may open it; a forbidden or unknown page,
 *   or none, falls back to the first visible page; nothing visible resolves to nothing.
