/**
 * Single-line truncated text: attaches a tooltip (hover to see the full text, the shared
 * panel read from `data-tooltip`) **only when actually truncated**, and only where nothing
 * else reveals the tail.
 *
 * The site-wide rule is "don't duplicate a tooltip when the element already shows
 * the text", but text whose tail is cut off by `truncate` isn't fully shown —
 * this is the one exception. Whether it overflows must be measured
 * (`scrollWidth > clientWidth`), and re-measured whenever the container's size
 * changes (sidebar collapse / window resize).
 *
 * `scrollReveal` additionally scrolls the clipped tail into view (#309): while
 * the nearest `data-title-reveal` ancestor (the sidebar conversation row) is
 * hovered or holds keyboard focus, the text slides left by the measured overflow
 * at a constant reading speed, holds at the end, and snaps back the instant the
 * hover/focus ends. The animation itself is pure CSS (styles.css
 * `title-scroll-reveal` keyframes) driven by the two custom properties set here:
 * this component only measures and publishes numbers. There are no timers, and
 * the reduced-motion query is one app-wide subscription shared by every row
 * (the UI package's usePrefersReducedMotion), not one per row.
 *
 * Which of the two discloses the tail is `titleDisclosure` (title-reveal.ts), and
 * they are alternatives: the tooltip covers the text the scroll cannot reach —
 * callers without `scrollReveal`, and scroll-reveal rows under reduced motion,
 * where the global `animation: none !important` block in styles.css disables the
 * keyframes outright and leaves the plain ellipsis. Where the reveal does run, no
 * tooltip is attached: having both put a tooltip over the very text sliding past
 * underneath it (#570). The full text always stays in the DOM either way, so the
 * accessible name carries it whole no matter how much of it is visually clipped.
 *
 * `codeTooltip` sets the panel as code, for a line that is a command rather than a name: a
 * command runs long, and reads whole only in monospace with its own line breaks. The same
 * rule decides whether the panel may open: it is held shut while the text fits.
