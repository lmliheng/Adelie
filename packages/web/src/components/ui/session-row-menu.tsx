/**
 * Actions on a sidebar Session row, and the two surfaces that offer them.
 *
 * The row carries a **pared-back hover affordance** and a **full context menu**, and this
 * module owns which actions belong to each so the two cannot drift:
 *
 * - Hovering a row reveals archive as a direct icon button plus an ellipsis "more"
 *   button that opens the context menu anchored at itself. The menu grew configuration
 *   actions (messaging binding) that right-click alone left undiscoverable, so the
 *   pointer entry is the ellipsis; delete moved inside the menu with them (still
 *   danger-styled there), keeping the hover surface to one safe direct action.
 * - Right-clicking a row (or holding it on touch, Shift+F10 on the keyboard, or clicking
 *   the ellipsis) opens the whole set — pin, rename, messaging, archive, copy id, delete —
 *   as a labelled menu.
 *
 * Rename therefore keeps a home: every Session must stay renamable, archivable and
 * deletable, and paring the hover affordance down would otherwise have dropped rename
 * off the row entirely.
 *
 * The surfaces themselves are the UI package's (`SessionRow`, `RowHoverActions`, the `MenuItem`
 * rows); this module says which actions they carry and in what words.
