/**
 * Sort mode and manual order of the sidebar's conversation rows (pure decisions, unit
 * tested). Two settings work together:
 *
 * - Sort mode — "recent" (the default: rows keep the store's newest-first order) or
 *   "manual" (drag-reorderable). One global key like the grouping mode: a single user
 *   preference, not per Project.
 * - Manual order — one array of Session ids per Project AND grouping mode (the modes cut
 *   the same Sessions into different partitions, so one shared array would let a drag in
 *   one mode scramble the other). Only the RELATIVE order of ids that render together in
 *   one partition ever matters (rows are compared only within a group's own list), so a
 *   drop simply rewrites the affected partition's sequence to the front of the array
 *   (applyManualReorder) — the caller must commit the partition's FULL loaded sequence,
 *   not the display-capped slice, or the hidden rows would fall out and return as
 *   "newcomers". Rows not in the array — new Sessions — go to the TOP of their partition
 *   keeping their recency order; stored ids that no longer exist stay inert (membership
 *   lookups only) and deletion prunes via removeFromSessionOrder.
 *
 * Ordering composes with the row pins (pinned-sessions.ts): the pinned cluster always
 * renders first, and the manual order applies WITHIN the pinned cluster and within the
 * rest independently — dragging never pins or unpins (orderSessionRows).
 *
 * Storage is injectable (model-group-expansion.ts convention: vitest runs in Node, no
 * localStorage); malformed values degrade to the defaults.
