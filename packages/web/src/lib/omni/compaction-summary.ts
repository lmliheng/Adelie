 * Split out of the banner component so it can be unit-tested (the Web test suite runs in a
 * node environment and renders no React). Extraction uses core's own lenient extractor, so
 * what the row shows is what the engine would adopt: the first non-empty tag pair, else the
 * text left after stripping empty tags, else the raw output verbatim — a summary still
 * mid-stream (opening tag written, closing tag not yet) therefore reads as plain text
 * rather than disappearing until the model closes the block.
