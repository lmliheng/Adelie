/**
 * The Settings dialog's pages, and who may see each one.
 *
 * Server-global pages write through /api/admin/settings (or the admin user routes) and
 * belong to admins alone; the personal pages are per-user preferences every signed-in user
 * owns (the credits page is one of them, open to everyone). Two pages additionally depend on
 * how this session runs: the account page only
 * exists where a password can be changed (see offersChangePassword), and user management
 * disappears in desktop mode, where the app is single-user. The profile page is neither — an
 * avatar and a nickname are display data, so every signed-in session may set them. Updating
 * is not a page here at all — both the server check and the desktop client's live in the
 * sidebar user menu, under the entry that opens this dialog. The rules live here rather than
 * inside the dialog because this package's vitest runs in Node with no DOM — a pure function
 * is the only thing a test can pin directly — and because rail and content have to apply the
 * same rule to avoid a visible-but-forbidden entry.
 *
 * A page the viewer may not open is dropped from the list entirely rather than rendered
 * disabled: a greyed-out "Proxy" row still tells a non-admin the setting exists and that
 * someone else can reach it.
 *
 * None of this is the boundary. The admin APIs answer a non-admin with 403 whatever the
 * browser chose to render.
