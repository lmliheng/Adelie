 * discarded unseen — demanding it would dead-end the one flow the session exists for.
 *
 * The desktop half is the two-field rule, not `sessionVia` alone, because the server is the
 * authority and its gate reads `deps.desktop !== null && sessionVia === "desktop"`. The two
 * used to be indistinguishable — a `desktop` session existed only where a shell had spawned
 * the server — but the shell now mints one for itself against a server it merely attached to,
 * and there the server still requires the old password. Keeping the shorter test would hide a
 * field the request must carry, and the submit would fail on a form that looked complete.

 * never shows, and the window cannot set one (`omitsOldPassword` follows the server, which asks
 * for the old password unless the server is the shell's own). Nagging there is a prompt with no
