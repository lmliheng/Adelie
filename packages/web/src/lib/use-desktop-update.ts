/**
 * The desktop shell's updater snapshot, shared by everything that reads it: the polling that
 * feeds it, the armed row-initiated check, and the three relay requests (check / download /
 * install). Client-mode half of the update flow — `use-update-flow.ts` reads the snapshot
 * through `useDesktopUpdate` and turns it into the modal's state.
 *
 * Everything lives at module level (use-version-info.ts convention): a check armed from the
 * modal must still settle after the modal is closed, and a download sent to the background
 * must keep reporting through the account-menu row. One always-mounted owner (the update
 * modal) drives the polling — fast while something is moving (checking, downloading, an
 * armed watch), lazily otherwise, and not at all when nothing is open and nothing moves: a
 * terminal snapshot (up to date, downloaded) cannot change between clicks.
