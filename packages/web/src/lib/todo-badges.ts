/**
 * The four DISMISSIBLE badge trails, and what a dismissal is stamped against.
 *
 * `update-badges.ts` next door covers the one trail that clears itself — a software release —
 * where there is nothing to dismiss: the badge is gone the moment the update is installed.
 * These four are different in one way that decides the whole design: the user may reasonably
 * look at what is waiting and choose to leave it there. A model table deliberately kept off
 * the catalog, a Skill deliberately pinned to an older copy, an Agent deliberately left on the
 * defaults generation it was tuned against, an error already read and understood — none of
 * those should keep a red dot lit forever, and none of them changes any state a gate could
 * read. (The library is a plugin library now — a Skill pinned to an older copy reads as a
 * plugin pinned, and the trail is the plugins one; nothing else about the argument moved.)
 *
 * So each trail produces a **signature**: a string naming exactly WHAT is waiting. Dismissing
 * stores that string (`todo-dismissals.ts`); the badge is raised again only when what is
 * waiting has grown BEYOND it. Acting on the trail therefore clears the badge on its own (the
 * signature becomes null), and so does dismissing — but something *new* arriving raises it
 * again, which a plain "hidden forever" flag could not do.
 *
 * Containment, never equality: the user dismisses two plugin updates, installs one of them, and
 * the remaining one must stay dismissed — it is the thing they already waved away. What
 * "beyond" means differs by the shape of what is waiting, which is what {@link TodoMatch}
 * names.
 *
 * Pure decisions only (vitest runs node-only here, so nothing renders and nothing fetches);
 * `use-project-todos.ts` wires them to the live stores and turns a count into localized copy.

 *   and only a HIGHER one raises the badge. Rows leave the window from either end — the row cap
 *   evicts the oldest, deleting an Agent removes its rows wherever they sit — so a signature

 * for the sync action itself. The other three cannot, and say so by leaving this absent rather
 * than reporting a zero — a plugin nobody has installed is not waiting for anyone, and an
 * Agent's kernel is never new, so "0 added" on those pages would be an answer to a question

 * alongside `node:crypto`, and pulling it into the browser bundle to sharpen a dismissal is a
 * bad trade. What makes the coarse form safe is that dismissing here silences only the page
 * notice and the nav dot: every outdated Agent keeps its own capsule on the list card and its
 * own update button in settings, so nothing the user waved away becomes unreachable. A NEW
 * Agent falling behind still raises it, which is the case a per-Project mute would lose.
