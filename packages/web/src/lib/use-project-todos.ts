/**
 * The two Project-scoped probes behind the dismissible badges, and their shared cache.
 *
 * The plugins trail needs no request at all — `AgentSummary.pluginUpdates` rides along on the
 * Agent list the Project context already loads. The other two do:
 *
 * - **models** — the built-in catalog lives in the client bundle, so the only missing half is
 *   the Project's saved model table. It is read through the models endpoint the page itself
 *   uses, and the delta is computed by the sync action's own code (`catalog-sync.ts`), which is
 *   what keeps the badge from ever leading to a button that answers "already up to date".
 * - **errors** — a one-row page of unexpected errors (`limit: 1`), which is all a badge needs:
 *   `total` is the count and `items[0]` the newest, i.e. the signature a dismissal is stamped
 *   against. The alternative was the cost center's whole dashboard aggregate, for two numbers.
 *
 * The window the error probe asks for is the cost center's OWN default range, not all of
 * history, and that is load-bearing rather than a saving: the page opens on the last 7 days, so
 * counting anything wider would raise a dot leading to a table with no rows in it.
 *
 * Both are cached per Project at module level and fetched once per browser session from the
 * single eager owner (`AppLayout`, through `use-update-badges.ts`); every other anchor reads
 * the cache passively and is pushed the result when it lands. Failures resolve to "nothing
 * known", clear the shared promise so a later activation retries, and surface nothing: an
 * unreachable probe leaves the gate closed and says nothing, exactly like the update check.
 * `refreshProjectTodos` is the acting user: after a sync or a plugin update the answer has
 * changed, and the badge must not wait for a reload to notice. It bumps a per-Project
 * generation so an in-flight probe from before the action cannot land on top of the answer
 * from after it.
