 * Stat icons: which registry glyph stands for each stat, shared as a single source by the chat

 *
 * Arrows read by "where the tokens go": **up = input** (sent up to the model), **down = output**
 * (returned by the model). The three surfaces used to carry their own copies of these paths, which
 * made it easy to flip the direction in one place and leave the others wrong — so the choice is
 * made here once, and the drawings live in the shared registry.
