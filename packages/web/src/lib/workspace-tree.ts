 *     row list the tree renders from the two (the row's own shape and the keyboard step over
 *     it are the UI package's `FileTree`'s, shared with the app's other file trees);
 *   - the search box's filter over the rows that are loaded;
 *   - which directory a dropped batch lands in;
 *   - when the panel is too narrow for a tree beside a preview, and how wide the tree pane
 *     may be dragged when it is not;
 *   - which files count as text — by extension, or by looking at their first bytes when
 *     the extension says nothing — and so can be previewed as text and edited in place, and
 *     how the read-only file browser previews a file by its name;
 *   - the persisted preferences (tree visibility, tree width, soft wrap) and the
 *     unsaved-changes decision;
 *   - what the panel's "add to conversation" puts in the composer — the `@path` reference,
 *     the fenced block a preview selection becomes, and where each of them may be spliced
 *     into a draft that is already half typed.
