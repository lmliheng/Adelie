/**
 * Context window resolution and the basis the composer's context ring fills against.
 *
 * Two different upper bounds live here, and confusing them is what this module exists to
 * prevent. `resolveContextWindow` answers "how much can this model hold at all" and falls back
 * to 128000 when a model entry has no `context_window`; it is what the Trace page's per-round
 * donuts and the model readouts want. The composer's ring wants the other one: the point
 * **compaction fires**, which is what decides whether to keep going or compact now. On a model
 * whose window dwarfs the Agent's threshold the two are far apart — 64k used against a 128k
 * threshold on a 1M window is half full, not 6% full — so the ring reads the threshold.
 *
 * The threshold arithmetic itself is core's (`effectiveMaxContextLength`), imported rather than
 * restated: the number drawn here has to be the number the Agent actually compacts at, and two
 * copies of that rule would eventually disagree.
 *
 * The panel's bar keeps the window as its scale, and marks the threshold on it with a draggable
 * cutter; the second half of this module is that cutter's arithmetic — pointer position to
 * proposed tokens, tokens to bar position, and what the window does to a value typed past it.
 * It lives here rather than in the component because it is the part worth pinning down: a
 * rounding or clamping mistake in a gesture that rewrites an Agent's configuration is not
 * something a render test would catch.
