/**
 * Where the Files panel's operations go. The panel is addressed by a Workspace, and a Workspace
 * is reached one of two ways:
 *
 *   - through a Session (`/api/sessions/:id/files…`): the conversation's own Workspace, routed to
 *     the machine the Session lives on by the path rule (lib/session-machines.ts);
 *   - by the directory itself (`/api/projects/:projectId/workspace-files…?workspace=`): the
 *     new-chat draft's chosen folder and a sidebar Workspace group, where no Session exists yet,
 *     sent to the machine that directory is on — a path names a directory only together with it.
 *
 * The two answer the same operations with the same results, except that previews on the
 * separate preview origin are a Session's alone (the origin's tokens name one): a directory's
 * HTML previews in the same-origin sandbox, which is what the panel shows when isolation is off.
