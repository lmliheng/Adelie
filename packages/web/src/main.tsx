/**
 * Frontend entry point: mounts the React root component (the frontend SPA is only
 * responsible for rendering and interaction).
 *
 * One thing happens before the mount: the browser's persisted UI state is reconciled
 * against the data root the server is actually serving (lib/install-scope.ts). It has to be
 * HERE and not in a provider, because the state it may clear is read from `useState`
 * initializers scattered through the tree — the sidebar's pins and order, the composer's
 * draft — and those run during the first render. A sweep that arrived one effect later
 * would let a stale draft be read once and then deleted underneath the component holding
 * it, which is worse than either doing nothing or doing it in time. Before `createRoot`
 * there is provably no component to have read anything.
 *
 * It costs one same-origin request to the server this page was just served by, and it is
 * bounded (see syncInstallScope): it can delay the first paint, it can never prevent it.
 *
 * A boot that actually swept RELOADS instead of mounting, and does not render at all on this
 * pass — every module in the static import graph was evaluated before this file ran, so any
 * that read the store at module scope is holding keys the sweep just removed. See
 * bootInstallScope for why that is the remedy rather than making those modules lazy.
