/**
 * The touch key bar: the keys a phone's soft keyboard does not have.
 *
 * Without it a terminal on a phone is read-only in practice — no Esc, no Tab completion, no
 * ↑ for the last command, and no Ctrl, so not even Ctrl+C. It renders only under
 * `(pointer: coarse)`; a device with a real keyboard already has every key on it.
 *
 * Two things make it behave like a keyboard rather than like buttons:
 *
 * - **Presses never move focus.** Every cap cancels its own `mousedown` — the event that
 *   moves focus, for a tap as much as for a click — so xterm's textarea keeps it and the
 *   soft keyboard does not slide away on the first tap of Esc. It has to be `mousedown` and
 *   not `pointerdown`: cancelling a touch `pointerdown` suppresses the compatibility events
 *   that follow it, and the cap's own `click` is one of them.
 * - **Ctrl and Alt are sticky, one shot.** A phone cannot hold a modifier down, so a tap
 *   arms it and the next character typed on the soft keyboard consumes it (the composition
 *   happens on the data path in terminal-view.tsx). Tapping again disarms.
 * - **Copy appears with a selection.** The select cap arms a mode in which a finger drags a
 *   selection out of the terminal (terminal-view.tsx); a phone has no Ctrl+C to copy it with,
 *   so the copy cap shows up for exactly as long as there is something to copy, and costs
 *   the other caps no width the rest of the time.
