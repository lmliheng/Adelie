/**
 * Cost trend chart (hand-drawn SVG, no chart library; a single accent color +
 * gray grid, desaturated in dark mode, no clashing red/green): a straight
 * polyline with a dot on every data point + a semi-transparent area layered
 * down to the baseline to reinforce the trend over time, with a hover vertical
 * line + whole-column hit area + bubble. The coordinate system / grid / hover
 * logic is chart-svg.tsx's ChartFrame (shared with the other usage charts).
 *
 * Canvas width = the container's measured pixels (1 unit = 1 pixel, see
 * chart-svg): the chart simply fills the container and never scrolls
 * horizontally.
 *
 * The caller hands over a series whose empty buckets have already been
 * dropped (usage-controls' compactSeries), so the points sit left to right
 * over only the intervals that recorded something and the geometry spreads
 * them across the card. A bucket that ran but has no priced model still
 * counts: it reads as a cost of 0, not a dash. `breaks` marks where the axis
 * skipped an interval.
