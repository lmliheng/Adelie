/**
 * Cost center stat charts: hand-drawn SVG / flex, no chart library. Every
 * chart is a time series over the page's shared date range and precision —
 * - RequestsChart: one dimension's requests and success rate on one pair of
 *   axes — per-bucket requests stacked by entity on the left count axis, one
 *   dashed success-rate line per entity on the right-hand 0–100% axis (drawn
 *   above the bars), a legend underneath. The page mounts it twice, by Agent
 *   and by Model, so both breakdowns are on screen without a toggle. Top
 *   entities keep their own CVD-checked hue and the tail folds into a neutral
 *   series labelled with how many it swallowed.
 * - TokenBarChart: per-bucket Token buckets as a three-segment stacked bar
 *   (bottom-to-top output → cacheWrite → cacheRead, same blue family, darkest
 *   at the bottom), with the cache hit rate as a dashed line **in front of the
 *   bars** on its own right-hand 0–100% axis. Bars always fit the card
 *   (fitBarWidth) — the charts never scroll.
 * Cost reuses TrendChart (straight line + area fill, with a dot per point
 * wherever the cells are wide enough to keep the dots apart).
 *
 * One x axis for the whole page: every chart is handed the same series with
 * its empty buckets already dropped (compactSeries, called once by the page),
 * so all four run left to right over the same intervals and can be read
 * against each other. A bucket only counts as empty when nothing at all was
 * recorded in it, so an entity that was idle while another one worked keeps
 * its place in that column — as a zero and a dash, not as a missing bucket.
 * `breaks` marks where the axis skipped an interval.
 *
 * Every data line is drawn at the theme's line width (the chart primitives), and a
 * bucket with no rate to show is drawn at NO_RATE_PLOT so the stroke stays
 * continuous. Neither is a
 * claim about the data: the hover table prints a dash there.
 *
 * Unified highlight interaction (a site-wide convention): highlight = fade
 * out the rest, and every chart offers the same three ways in: hover a column
 * for its bubble, hover one bar segment to single that segment out, hover a
 * line's own band to single the line out. A legend item does what hovering
 * its mark does. Line hit bands sit above the bars' in every chart, so a line
 * answers the pointer wherever it runs.
