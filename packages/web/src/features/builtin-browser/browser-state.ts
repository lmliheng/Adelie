/**
 * The built-in browser's state in this window, as a pure reducer.
 *
 * Two lists, from two sources:
 * - `tabs` is the SERVER's registry — what the desktop shell reports about every guest page
 *   (address, title, loading, history) and which one is active. The strip and the toolbar
 *   render from it, and the user channel's `builtin_browser_tabs` event replaces it whole.
 * - `guests` are the `<webview>` elements THIS window hosts, in creation order. A guest starts
 *   from a `builtin_browser_open` request, learns its tab id once it attaches, and is removed
 *   by a close. The order is the DOM order of the elements and must never change: moving a
 *   webview in the DOM reloads its page, so guests are only ever appended or removed.
 *
 * Activity (`builtin_browser_activity`) marks the tabs an agent is working in right now, the
 * homepage is the server's setting as this window last read or saved it, and the metrics are the
 * browser's load with the server's verdict on it (`builtin_browser_metrics`, about every 10 s).
 *
 * The browser keeps a tab while its panel is on screen: with none open and none on its way, the
 * window opens the new-tab page by itself (`wantsNewTabPage`), the homepage or a blank page.
