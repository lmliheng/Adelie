/**
 * QQ scan-to-connect — the alternative to copying an App ID and an App Secret out of the QQ
 * developer console by hand: a QR code, scanned in the QQ app, that hands the credentials
 * straight to the server.
 *
 * What this component may and may not know is the whole design. The server registers a bind
 * task under an AES key it keeps, and this component receives a task handle, a URL, and a
 * status. It never sees the key, and it never sees the App Secret — a completed poll returns
 * the App ID and the saved binding, because the credentials went into storage server-side
 * without passing back through the browser. That is the same rule that keeps a stored secret
 * from round-tripping through the form above it.
 *
 * The QR is rendered from the URL locally rather than fetched as an image: the URL is short,
 * a generated `<svg>` stays crisp at any size, and an image request would put the task handle
 * into a third party's logs.
 *
 * Dark-on-white in both themes, deliberately. A QR inverted for a dark background is read
 * unreliably by phone cameras that assume dark modules on a light field, and a scan that
 * silently fails on half the machines is worse than a white plate in a dark panel.
