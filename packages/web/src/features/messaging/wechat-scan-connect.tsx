/**
 * WeChat scan-to-connect — the ONLY way to bind this channel, rather than QQ's convenient
 * alternative to typing credentials: a WeChat bot token exists nowhere a person could copy
 * it from, so this component is the whole of the credential form.
 *
 * What it may and may not know is the design, and it is the same rule qq-scan-connect.tsx
 * follows. The server holds the platform's poll handle — the thing that turns into a bot
 * token — and this component receives a task id it mints instead, plus a URL and a status. A
 * completed poll returns the bot's id and the saved binding, because the credential went into
 * storage server-side without passing back through the browser.
 *
 * The QR is rendered from the URL locally rather than fetched as an image: the URL is short,
 * a generated `<svg>` stays crisp at any size, and an image request would put the handle into
 * a third party's logs. Dark-on-white in both themes, for the reason the QQ panel documents:
 * a code inverted for a dark background is read unreliably by phone cameras.
 *
 * ## The pairing code
 *
 * WeChat may interpose a step QQ has no equivalent of: the phone shows a short number that
 * has to be entered here before the authorization completes. It arrives as a status rather
 * than an error, so the panel grows an input in place instead of tearing the code down — the
 * QR is still the thing being authorized, and taking it off screen mid-flow would strand the
 * user. A wrong number is not reported as a failure either: the platform simply asks again,
 * which reaches here as the same status a second time.
