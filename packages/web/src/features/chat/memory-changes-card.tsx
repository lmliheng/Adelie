/**
 * Memory-change summary card, rendered right below the file-summary card at the end of a
 * root Task (the same card, the UI package's ChangesCard): one row per memory topic file the
 * Task changed through the structured file tools, derived by the stream model
 * (TaskStatsItem.memoryChanges — see lib/omni/memory-changes.ts for what qualifies and what is
 * filtered).
 *
 * Clicking a row opens the Memory side panel directly on that memory's content; the header's
 * "Open memory list" text action opens the panel on its list. The action is words, in the rows'
 * own "View content" hint style: a brain glyph there would only repeat the card's own mark beside
 * it, and say nothing of where it leads. A changed file that was deleted in a later turn is
 * filtered out (deletedKeys) — the row disappears here just as it does from the panel's list;
 * the whole card hides when nothing survives.
