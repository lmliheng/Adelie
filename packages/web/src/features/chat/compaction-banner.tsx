/**
 * Compaction row: one StepBanner across running/done/failed (same shell as the MCP
 * connect row and the reasoning-&-tools group header) — the wall time ticks while it runs
 * and settles once finished, failures stay on a single line.
 *
 * **The title names the mode and doubles as the status**, the work-group header's idiom
 * (运行中 → 运行完毕): a `summarize` row reads 压缩中 / "Compacting" while it runs and
 * 压缩完毕 / "Compacted" once it settles; a `discard` row 清空中 → 清空完毕 ("Clearing" →
 * "Cleared") — it drops the old context rather than compacting it, and calling that
 * "compaction" was the confusing part (per maintainer request). With mode and state both in
 * the title neither outcome needs a detail line: a running row is icon + title + ticking wall
 * time (+ chevron on a summarize), a succeeded row the same with the time settled, and the
 * detail slot is left for the one thing a title cannot say — why a compaction failed, under
 * the bare mode word.
 *
 * The body follows the work group: **two stacked disclosure rows, each with its own status
 * icon and wall time exactly like a thinking block** — 「思考」/ "Thinking", what the
 * compaction request thought ahead of its summary (present only once any arrived; a model
 * that does not think leaves no empty row), and 「压缩结果」/ "Result", the summary itself.
 * Both carry the thinking block's own body (`md-body` + the streaming `Md`) and stream while
 * the request writes them.
 *
 * Two layers, and the running row opens exactly one of them (StepBanner's expand policy, the
 * work group's): while the compaction runs the banner is open, so the two section rows are on
 * screen with their labels and their ticking times — the reader can see that they are there
 * and how long each is taking — while the sections themselves stay closed (DisclosureRow's
 * default), because their contents are the compaction's raw workings and not what the row is
 * for. Once the compaction settles the banner closes itself again, leaving the one-line
 * summary. The sections arrive in the order the request produces them: the thinking section
 * once any thinking lands, the result section only after that thinking finishes — its first
 * summary token is what settles the thinking section — so a running row never shows a result
 * row beside a thought still being written (compactionResultVisible decides).
 *
 * The header's chevron is there from the moment a summarize compaction starts, so the reader
 * can reopen it to watch the request work, or read the outcome afterwards. A `discard`
 * compaction produces no text at all and stays chevron-less, as does a failed one: a
 * compaction that did not complete wrote no adopted summary, and the reducer discards its
 * half-written drafts (see stream-model's compaction_end handling), so there is nothing left
 * to show.
 *
 * Doesn't show Tokens: the row only needs to state whether compaction happened and whether it
 * succeeded. Compaction's cost lands in different places depending on when it occurs — compaction
 * that happens **mid-turn** counts toward that turn's stats line and cost; compaction **after a
 * turn ends** and manual compaction both go into the Session total (the Trace page lists
 * compaction turns separately); see the task-stats module comments.
