/**
 * The draft screen's user-defined shortcuts: prompts the user wrote and saved, one click away
 * from the composer. Storage, shape and the rules the editor enforces all live here.
 *
 * **Where they are stored, and why it is not the browser.** These are per-user server state
 * (`ui_prefs.draftShortcuts`, PUT /api/me/prefs), not localStorage. Every other draft-screen
 * preference — the cached draft, the collapsed groups, the sidebar width — can be recreated by
 * doing the thing again; a prompt the user typed and named cannot. Losing it by opening the app
 * on another machine, or by clearing site data, would be losing their work.
 *
 * **A shortcut is a title and a prompt, and pins no Skills.** A built-in example is authored
 * against the Skill catalog this product ships, so it can name the Skills its prompt depends on;
 * a prompt the user saved has no such guarantee, and the Agent it will eventually run under is
 * picked *after* the click. Pinning would therefore mean either silently dropping names the
 * selected Agent lacks, or growing the editor a Skill picker whose contents change with a
 * selection made elsewhere on the page. The composer's own Skills dropdown is one click away and
 * keeps working: a shortcut fills the text and leaves the selection exactly as the user set it.
 *
 * **The caps are duplicated on the server on purpose** (`services/draft-shortcuts.ts`), which is
 * where they are enforced — ui_prefs is a free-form JSON column, so a bound that lives only in
 * this editor is not a bound at all. The numbers here drive the counters and the disabled states;
 * `test/user-shortcuts.test.ts` fails if the two copies drift apart.
