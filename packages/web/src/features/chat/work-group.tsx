/**
 * The session's "Reasoning & Tools" group: binds a run of consecutive thinking and tool-call
 * items to the shared UI package's `WorkGroup`, which draws it and owns its expand policy.
 *
 * What is decided here is the group's state, from the stream model:
 *
 * - Running vs Done: the group only counts as done once the model stops calling tools. While it
 *   is the last segment and the Task runs, the model could add another step at any moment (with
 *   a brief gap between two steps where no item is active), so it shows "Running"; it flips to
 *   "Done" once a later message pushes it away from the end, or the Task finishes. Following this
 *   rather than the per-item activity is what keeps the group from collapsing between steps.
 * - A pending approval anywhere in the group forces it open: the approval buttons live inside.
 * - The duration is `summarizeWork`'s span; it ticks only while an item is in flight.
