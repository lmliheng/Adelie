/**
 * Draft view (/chat/new): the pre-persistence form of a new
 * conversation, before any Session exists. The input card sits vertically centered;
 * before sending, this is where Agent / Workspace / approval mode / Model are all
 * chosen in one place — two small dropdown pills sit right below the card (pill
 * buttons, styled after ChatGPT's project picker): Agent selection and Workspace
 * directory selection (the menu browses server-side directories, and the current
 * path can be edited directly); the model picker lives in the input card's bottom
 * toolbar, left of the send button (with a vendor logo). The Session is only
 * created when **the first message is sent**; once created, Agent / Workspace /
 * Model are locked in via meta, and only approval mode remains editable (in the
 * session-mode input area).
 *
 * Draft auto-cache (storage and validation in draft-cache.ts; keys are isolated by
 * "user × Project", #68): the four selections are saved as soon as they change;
 * body text is keystroke-frequent and deferred/coalesced (if there's an unsaved
 * change before unmount, one final write is flushed) — closing and returning to
 * the page resumes where you left off; on successful send the cache clears, except
 * the model selection, which carries over as the next conversation's default
 * (switch-becomes-default, mirroring the thinking level persisting on the Agent).
 * The one thing that does not resume is a prompt a "Create with AI" surface composed
 * (`aiPrefill`, draft-cache.ts): nobody typed it, so leaving this page without editing
 * or sending it clears the slot exactly as a send would (see dropAiPrefill).
 * Every "New chat" entry point first rewrites the slot to the model carry-over and staged
 * skills, releasing whatever else an earlier visit left in the cache (prepareNewChatDraft,
 * new-chat.ts), then names in route state only what it is about: an Agent group's "+" or
 * an Agent card names its Agent, a Workspace group's "+" its path ("" = temporary
 * workspace), and the plain "New chat" names nothing. A direct visit or refresh keeps the
 * cache. Precedence per field: route state > draft cache > the Project's new-chat defaults
 * ([default_chat]) > built-in fallback (for the Agent: default_agent, then the first —
 * newChatAgentId); the model default already flows through models.defaultModel.
 *
 * Saving the Project's new-chat defaults resets the seeded selections so new chats pick
 * the change up: the project-settings dialog strips the cached pins (next visits reseed
 * from the fresh defaults) and dispatches a same-tab chat-defaults-changed event that a
 * MOUNTED draft answers by resetting Agent / Workspace / approval mode / Model in
 * component state (see onDefaultsChanged) — typed-but-unsent text and staged skills
 * always survive.
