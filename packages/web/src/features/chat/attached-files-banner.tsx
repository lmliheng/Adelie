 * Attachment notice for a message's uploaded files: the `[attached file: <path>]` lines the

 * in the session scratchpad and the model opens them by path); the body text around them is
 * rendered as usual by the caller. It keeps the same visual language as message-level notices;
 * the caller owns its user-side alignment and timestamp footer.
