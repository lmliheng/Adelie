/**
 * The code viewer's highlighting entry point: the same call as before, answered on a worker.
 *
 * Tokenizing is linear in the size of the file — about four milliseconds per kilobyte of
 * TypeScript, measured on this app's own sources — and it runs to completion once it starts. On
 * the main thread that put a hard ceiling on what could be coloured at all, because half a
 * megabyte meant two seconds of frozen page. A worker removes the ceiling rather than raising it:
 * the code renders unhighlighted, the colours replace it when they land, and nothing blocks.
 *
 * The worker is created on the first call and kept for the page's life, so a conversation pays for
 * the engine and each grammar once. Where a worker cannot be had at all — a runtime without it, a
 * CSP that forbids it, a construction that throws — the work falls back to this thread, which is
 * exactly the old behaviour and still correct, only blocking.
