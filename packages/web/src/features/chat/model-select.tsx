 * switch opens too. The chat composer, the Project settings' new-chat defaults, the schedule
 * form, the organization dialogs and the benchmark dialog all pick a model through it. The
 * composer's other switch picker, the `/agent` handoff, is the UI package's PickerList.

 * Model selector: the trigger shows the provider logo + name and opens the model-picker dialog
 * (search, provider-group rail, key-configured-first listing, Free badge — documented there). A
 * pick closes the dialog and reports `{ provider, modelId }` through `onChange`.
 *
 * Two trigger variants, one dialog:
 * - "pill" (default): the composer's compact toolbar button — collapses to the logo alone
 *   under the card's own `@container` query;
 * - "form": the shared form trigger (full-width, Input/Select-styled), used by every dialog
 *   host. The picker opened from inside a dialog stacks above it as a second Modal, and Escape
 *   closes only the picker.
 *
 * `emptyLabel` is for the one kind of host where an unpicked model is a decision and not a
 * gap — the organization dialogs, where an empty model means "follow the Project's default".
 * The picker still offers models only, so such a host carries its own way back to the empty
 * value; here the label is grayed as a placeholder and the provider logo is dropped, since no
 * provider is being named.
