/**
 * Context composition rows: the server's estimated parts, re-expressed on the scale the context

 *
 * The server splits a Session's current model context into six parts and ranks the tools, and
 * the files the file tools named, whose traffic occupies the most of it, sizing everything with
 * a character heuristic rather than a tokenizer (this project bundles none). Taken as counts
 * those figures would contradict the ring, which reports the provider's own measurement; taken
 * as **shares** they are exactly what the ring cannot say. So each part is expressed as its
 * share of the estimate, applied to `now` — the parts add up to the occupancy in the panel
 * header, and the estimate's absolute error never reaches the display.
 *
 * Pure, no React: unit-tested in test/context-parts.test.ts, rendered by context-gauge.tsx.
