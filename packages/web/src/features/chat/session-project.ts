 * that was merged in by such a lookup — an organization's desk, opened from the org chart,
 * is exactly that row, and losing it again is what left the conversation behind the skeleton
 * for good. The list row still WINS where it exists: it is the one the status and title

 * different facts wearing one face: the row is gone, or the array on hand is one tick old.
 * A source that answers slower than its siblings, a machine that misses a round, a Session
 * whose category changed under a page that is not loaded — all of them un-name a live
 * conversation for a tick. Taking that for "gone" is what paints the skeleton over a
 * conversation being read; holding the last answer through it is what this is for.
 *
 * The hold is released the moment either thing that could make it a LIE happens: the route
 * moved to another Session, or the direct lookup came back and said this one is not there.
 * So a deleted Session still leaves the screen — one tick later than it used to.
