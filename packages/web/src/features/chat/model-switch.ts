 * and leaves this one as it is; this picker keeps the conversation and moves it onto the
 * picked model. That compacts on the current model first (`POST …/switch-model` answers 202 and
 * streams an ordinary compaction row, then the new context's `session_meta`), except for a
 * Session that never ran, which has no context to compact and switches inside the request (200
 * with the updated Session). Only that `session_meta` says the Session moved: the stream model
 * turns it into a model-change marker, and the page moves its Session row to the model it
 * names (see sessionRowStale). A compaction that fails streams no meta, and the Session stays
 * on the model it was on.
