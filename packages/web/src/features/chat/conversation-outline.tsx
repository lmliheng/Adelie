/**
 * Conversation minimap, in two shapes sharing one data model (outline-model.ts):
 *
 * - `ConversationOutline` — a tick rail overlaying the left gutter of the message stream:
 *   one tick per exchange, the reading position emphasized; hovering (or focusing) a tick
 *   pops a floating preview card (question bold over a truncated reply preview), clicking
 *   jumps. It costs the conversation no width, and the preview card mounts only for the
 *   hovered tick — at rest the rail duplicates no message text into the DOM (which would
 *   pollute text lookup for assistive tech and tests alike). The overlay is
 *   hit-transparent (pointer events only on the ticks), so wheel scrolling anywhere in
 *   the gutter keeps scrolling the stream. Rendered into MessageStream's relative wrapper
 *   via its `outline` slot, so the rail spans exactly the stream area — never the composer.
 *   Long conversations don't stack every turn: the rail renders a sliding window of ticks
 *   around the reading position (`windowOutline`, its width sized to the measured rail
 *   height so the stack can never spill over the toolbar or composer), tiny edge dots
 *   standing in for the turns hidden past it, and labels keep their global turn numbers.
 *
 * - `OutlineMenuButton` — the fallback for when the rail cannot show: a toolbar icon
 *   button (top right) opening a dropdown index of the same entries, tap to jump. Phones
 *   are the primary case (no hover pointer, no gutter), but it also covers a desktop
 *   window whose gutter a docked panel has eaten — navigation stays reachable either way.
 *   The dropdown list scrolls, so it stays complete — no windowing here.
 *
 * Which shape shows is the owner's call via `useOutlineRailFit`: the rail needs a
 * hover-capable pointer and a live-measured gutter (ResizeObserver — window resizes and
 * panel drags both count), and the menu button renders exactly when the rail cannot.
 * Below OUTLINE_MIN_TURNS turns neither shape renders at all — that short a conversation
 * needs no index.
 *
 * Jump targets are the [data-outline-anchor] wrappers MessageItems stamps at the top
 * level only, queried scoped to the stream's scroll container (item ids repeat across
 * nested subagent models, so document-wide lookups would be ambiguous). The active-entry
 * computation considers only anchors that ARE entries: banner-only messages, merged image
 * fragments and later goal rounds carry anchors too, and crossing one of those must
 * highlight the entry that covers it rather than nothing.
