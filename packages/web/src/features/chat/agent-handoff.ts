/**
 * Agent handoff for the chat input area (pure logic, shared by chat-input.tsx /
 * chat-page.tsx and unit tests). A target agent is picked from the `/agent` command's picker
 * and pinned as a highlighted chip at the front of the input; the text body carries no marker
 * of its own. Nothing is sent at pick time — sending is what performs the handoff, and it
 * opens a NEW conversation for that agent instead of posting to the current Session.
 * - `filterAgents`: the picker's search box — filters candidates by agentId or display name.
 * - `stagedSendRoute`: where a send goes once a switch chip is staged (and when a staged
 *   `/model` fork must refuse to go at all).
 *
 * The origin **marker blocks** these flows produce and render — `[handoff_from]`,
 * `[scheduled_task]`, `[model_switch_from]` — are defined in core's marker module
 * (`@lmliheng/penguin-core/markers`) alongside every other message marker, and are
 * re-exported below under this feature's existing names.

 * off **this** Session's Trace, so it may only run while this Session is idle. A run can start
 * from outside the composer at any time — a queued follow-up auto-sending, a scheduled Task
 * firing, another tab or the CLI posting — and forking then would point the new model at a
 * Trace that is still being appended to, while navigating the user away from a live run. Rather
 * than silently falling through to `post` (which would deliver the message to the very Session
 * the user was switching away from), the send is refused until the Session goes idle.
 *
 * A staged handoff has no such constraint: it never reads or writes the running Session.
