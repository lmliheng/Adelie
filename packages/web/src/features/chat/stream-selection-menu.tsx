/**
 * The conversation's own context menu: a secondary click — or Shift+F10, or the keyboard's
 * Menu key — inside the message stream. On a web link it offers Open in built-in browser (the
 * desktop app, with the browser available), Open in system browser (Open in new tab from a
 * browser) and Copy link address; on a selection, Copy and Add to conversation; on a link
 * while text is selected, both, the selection's rows after a divider. The rules (which gestures
 * it takes, which rows it shows, where a keyboard-opened menu hangs, what an excerpt becomes)
 * are pure and live in lib/selection-menu.ts; this half reads the DOM and runs the rows.
 *
 * It is the Files panel preview's selection menu applied to the conversation, and it borrows
 * that menu's parts instead of copying them: `useRowContextMenu` for the anchored open state
 * and its dismissal, the `Dropdown` in `anchorRect` mode for the panel, the small Menu rows,
 * and `restoreSelection` for the highlight. It is also what gives the desktop app a
 * copy menu for conversation text, and a menu for its links, since Electron raises no context
 * menu of its own.
 *
 * Whatever the rules decline is left to the browser untouched: `preventDefault` runs only once
 * the rules have taken the gesture, inside the stream's own handler, so a right-click with no
 * selection and off a web link, on a field, or on a selection that runs out of the stream still
 * gets the native menu. A touch or pen press-and-hold is declined outright — the OS selection
 * and link menus own that gesture — which is why none of the hook's press-and-hold handlers are
 * spread here.
