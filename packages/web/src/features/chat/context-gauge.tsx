/**
 * Context usage gauge in the composer toolbar, and the composition panel behind it. The ring is
 * the UI package's `ContextRing`; this module decides what it fills against, names it, and opens
 * the panel from it.
 *
 * The resting state is the ring alone: a **single-colour** indicator of total occupancy (no
 * bucketing), turning amber past 80% and red past 95%. The exact `used/basis` figures are not
 * printed beside it — the panel a click away leads with them, and hovering the ring names them
 * too.
 *
 * What it fills against is the **effective compaction threshold**, not the model window: the
 * question a reader brings to this ring is how much room is left before the context is
 * summarized away, and against a window that dwarfs the threshold every answer looks like
 * "plenty" (64k used at a 128k threshold on a 1M window would draw 6% instead of 50%). The
 * basis therefore comes from contextFillBasis, which caps the Agent's configured threshold by
 * what the window leaves room for — exactly the derivation the Agent itself compacts at. Where
 * no threshold applies it falls back to the window: compaction switched off, and a caller with
 * no Agent config to give (the subagent composer).
 *
 * `unknown` (a compaction succeeded and the next regular Request has not reported usage yet)
 * draws an empty ring. **Never a full-looking 0**: that would claim the context had been cleared
 * while the summary itself occupies tokens. Nothing has been measured yet, which is not the same
 * as having measured zero — and the panel says exactly that rather than describing the context
 * that was just compacted away.
 *
 * Given a `sessionId` the ring becomes a button that discloses the panel, which answers what the
 * ring cannot: what the context is full of. The server splits the Session's newest Trace shard —
 * one shard is one complete model context — into six parts and ranks the tools whose traffic
 * occupies the most of it, and the files the file tools named; a switch above the ranking picks
 * which of the two it lists. Those figures come from a character heuristic, not a tokenizer (this
 * project bundles none), so only their **shares** are used: each part is drawn as its share of
 * `now`, the measured occupancy the ring itself shows. The parts therefore always add up to the
 * figure in the panel header, and the estimate's absolute error never reaches the display; the
 * `~` on every derived value marks what is still an approximation.
 *
 * The bar runs to the **model window**, not to the threshold the ring uses. The two answer
 * different questions and each keeps its own scale: the ring says how close compaction is, the
 * bar says how much model there is and where inside it the trigger sits — drawn as a dashed
 * cutter at the effective threshold. Making both read the threshold cost the bar its only
 * answer, since a bar that ends on the trigger point can no longer show the room past it. The
 * header carries the ring's figures (`used / threshold`) and the bar names its own scale
 * underneath itself, so neither number has to be inferred from the other. While the panel is open
 * the server's own reading of the threshold wins over the client's: both come from the same
 * derivation, so they differ only when the Agent's config changed after this page loaded. The
 * parts subdivide the filled run; their exact shares are the legend's job, since at low
 * occupancy the run is only a few pixels wide. Hovering a segment or its legend row links the
 * two: the row lights up and the other segments fade, and clicking either pins that link until
 * it is clicked again or another part is picked — the pinned legend row carries a ring as well
 * as the wash, so it does not read as a hover that happened to stay. The stretch past the
 * cutter is hatched rather than plain: it is room the model has but compaction fires before the
 * Session can use, and it follows the pending value while the cutter is dragged.
 *
 * The cutter is also the control that moves the threshold. Dragging it (or focusing it and
 * using the arrow keys) proposes a value on a 1,000-token lattice, and the release opens a
 * confirmation carrying an editable number — a gesture this coarse must not write a
 * configuration value on its own, and the dialog is also where a threshold above the window can
 * be typed deliberately. Confirming writes the Agent's `compaction.max_context_length` and it
 * applies to this conversation at once, without waiting for a compaction to rotate the context.
 * While a proposal is in flight the panel's own dismissal stands down (see `gesture` below):
 * Esc has to cancel the adjustment and then the dialog, and the dialog's overlay would
 * otherwise read as a click outside the panel.
 *
 * The panel is portaled to document.body and positioned against viewport coordinates by
 * usePortalPanel, so the composer's own overflow cannot clip it, and it closes on outside click /
 * Esc / a scroll that moves the ring itself / resize — the message list scrolling under a
 * streaming reply leaves it open. It opens upward on its own: the composer sits at the bottom of
 * the page, so there is never room below.

/**
 * The dashed mark on the bar at the effective compaction threshold — and the control that moves

 * pointer target, and the value being proposed while a gesture is running.
 *
 * The gesture is deliberately coarse and deliberately does not commit. It snaps to
 * `THRESHOLD_STEP` because nobody means 127,431 tokens, it stops at the bar's own ends, and its
 * release hands the value to a confirmation rather than writing it: a stray drag across a panel
 * must not silently re-configure an Agent, and the dialog is where a threshold above the window
 * can still be typed on purpose.
 *
 * Keyboard reaches the same place: `role="slider"` with the arrow keys on the same lattice
 * (Shift takes ten steps), Enter for the release and Escape to abandon the adjustment. Escape
 * gets to stop here rather than closing the panel because the gauge suspends the panel's own
 * key handling while a proposal is pending. The pending value also lives up there, so the
 * suspension and the mark can never disagree about whether a gesture is running.
