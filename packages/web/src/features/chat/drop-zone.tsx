/**
 * Drop target for composer attachments (#311), scoped to the chat area: dragging OS files
 * over the conversation + composer column shows a "drop to attach" overlay bounded to that
 * column, and releasing hands the batch to the composer's existing intake (images → the
 * pasted-image pipeline, everything else → the file-attachment pipeline; same validation,
 * same errors).
 *
 * Two pieces, because the region and the composer are not the same element:
 *   - `ChatDropRegion` wraps the chat column (chat-page.tsx) and publishes its DOM node
 *     through context. It is the only element a drop counts on: the sidebar, the mobile top
 *     bar, the chat toolbar and the docked Files/Subagents panels sit outside it and are
 *     inert, and pages with no chat column never render one.
 *   - `FileDropZone` stays mounted by ChatInput, which keeps "dropping works exactly when
 *     there is a composer to attach to" true by construction — chat page and draft page
 *     alike, and while a Task runs just the same. With no region above it (nothing does that
 *     today) it renders nothing and listens for nothing, rather than falling back to the
 *     window.
 *
 * The listeners are on `window` even though the target is a region, because the region only
 * needs to be the *subject* of the hit test, not the receiver: a window listener still sees
 * the drag after it has moved off the chat column — over the sidebar, over a docked panel,
 * out of the window — which is exactly when the overlay has to come down. Every event is
 * tested against the region with `contains`, so where the pointer is decides everything and
 * no state accumulates (see dropRegionAction in lib/file-drop.ts for why that matters).
 *
 * The overlay is the UI package's `DropOverlay` veil, pure feedback: `pointer-events-none` (so
 * it never becomes the drag target itself and the hit test keeps seeing the real element
 * underneath), `aria-hidden` — it exists only during a pointer drag, and the accessible entry
 * point stays the "+" menu — and `absolute inset-0` portaled into the region, on the overlay z
 * tier (z-50).
 *
 * Interplay with the app-shell guard (see lib/file-drop.ts): over the chat area this
 * component claims the drag — preventDefault on dragover plus a copy cursor — so the guard's
 * no-drop fallback stands aside; everywhere else the guard alone runs, silently cancelling
 * the browser's navigate-to-file default so a stray drop is inert instead of destructive,
 * while non-file drags keep their native behavior. Both orders of the two window listeners
 * converge on the same outcome, so mount order cannot matter.
