/**
 * Workspace file browser (the Files panel): a directory tree on the left, listing each
 * directory the first time it opens, and a preview of the selected file on the right —
 * Markdown / HTML rendered with a source toggle, text inline (highlighted), images inline
 * (click to zoom), PDF embedded, everything else offered as a download. Text files can be
 * edited in place: Edit swaps the preview for a plain textarea, Save writes the file back
 * through the content endpoint, and unsaved changes are guarded wherever they could be
 * lost. The editor keeps its place as a code editor does — it opens where the preview was
 * scrolled, a save leaves it open with caret and scroll untouched, and when a finished turn
 * rewrote the file under an editor holding nothing unsaved, it takes the new text in place.
 * OS files dropped anywhere on the panel upload into the current directory — onto a folder
 * row, into that folder. New text files and folders are made from the tree header's New
 * menu, a folder's menu or the blank space under the tree; folders rename and move whole.
 *
 * The panel is addressed by its scope (api/workspace-files.ts): a Session's Workspace on the
 * chat page, or a directory named by its path on the new-chat draft, where no Session exists
 * yet. Everything below follows the scope; a new scope starts the panel over.
 *
 * A search box above the tree filters the rows the lazy tree has already loaded. The tree
 * can be hidden (toolbar toggle, shown by default), and the divider between the two panes
 * sets its width; both, and the editor's soft-wrap toggle, are browser preferences.
 * The panel's width is the dock's, which may be far narrower than the viewport, so the
 * layout follows a measured width rather than a viewport breakpoint: below
 * TREE_LAYOUT_MIN_WIDTH the panes stop sharing the row and the tree and the preview show
 * one at a time — selecting a file replaces the tree, Back returns to it, and the divider
 * has nothing to divide. Path scoping is the server's job (including creating missing
 * parent directories inside the sandbox).
 *
 * The toolbar is one row that never wraps: the breadcrumbs read the current path (the tree
 * beside them is what navigates), and when the path outgrows the space its leading segments
 * collapse into a single "…" so Refresh and Upload keep their places.
 *
 * A secondary click carries the panel's per-entry actions — copy the relative path, add a
 * `@path` reference to the conversation, upload into a folder, download a file — on the tree
 * rows and again on the preview body, where the file it acts on is the one being previewed
 * and a selection inside it can be added as a fenced block instead of the whole file. Two
 * gestures reach nothing and are left to the browser on purpose: inside the HTML and PDF
 * previews, which are iframes no handler on this side can hear, and inside the in-place
 * editor, where the native menu is how text gets pasted.
 *
 * This file is the container: it lists, fetches, edits, uploads and guards. What the panel looks
 * like is the UI package's — the tree pane (`TreePane` over `FileTree`), the preview pane
 * (`PreviewPane`, with `WorkspaceFileEditor` in it while a file is edited), the draggable split
 * between them (`SplitPane`), the path strip (`Breadcrumbs`), the drop feedback (`DropOverlay`)
 * and the file menu's rows (`WorkspaceFileMenuRows`).
