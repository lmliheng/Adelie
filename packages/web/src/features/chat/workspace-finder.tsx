/**
 * The Workspace finder: the modal every Workspace picker opens (workspace-select.tsx keeps the
 * triggers). It browses one machine's folders the way a desktop file manager's open dialog
 * does — places on the left, the current folder as a list, navigation buttons and an address
 * bar above it, Choose below — and hands back a folder and the machine it is on. Where the
 * platforms' file managers differ it takes Explorer's habits: the address bar turns into a
 * path field when clicked, a secondary click opens a context menu, and Quick access is the
 * user's to edit, starting from the standard folders of the browsed machine's own platform.
 *
 * It is a Modal like any other dialog, so it stacks on the dialogs that host the form variant
 * without anything of its own: Modal portals to body (a later modal sits above an earlier one in
 * DOM order) and joins the shared Escape stack, so one Escape closes the finder and leaves the
 * host dialog open, and closing hands focus back to the trigger.
 *
 * The component stays mounted while closed, so it reopens where it was browsing when the host
 * has no Workspace set yet (the sidebar's new-workspace button picks one after another from the
 * same place); with one set, it reopens revealing that folder in its parent.
 *
 * It changes the folder it shows in exactly two ways, both on this server's own filesystem: New
 * folder makes one inside the folder being browsed, and Delete removes one — never a folder
 * with anything in it, never the root or the Project's own directory, and only after the
 * confirmation card says so (features/chat/workspace-finder-model.ts decides what either menu
 * offers).
