/**
 * File summary card for a supplied assistant-text scope: the root conversation passes a
 * completed Task's aggregated assistant text, while nested conversations — which don't produce
 * task_stats — pass one settled assistant message to preserve their existing behavior. Extracts
 * inline-code paths heuristically via isFilePathLike, normalizes them to Workspace-relative
 * paths, confirms they actually exist via files/stat, and renders them as the UI package's
 * ChangesCard — an "N files" card whose rows open the Files panel, folded past 3 rows.
 *
 * The card waits for stat results and doesn't render when no candidate exists. It intentionally
 * does not claim these files were changed: opaque exec_command shells provide no reliable
 * structured edit signal, so this is only an aggregated view of text references that are
 * currently openable.
