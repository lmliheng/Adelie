/**
 * Top-right dock switcher of the chat toolbar (Codex-style): exactly two icon toggles — pull
 * open the bottom dock, pull open the right dock — drawn by the UI package's `PanelsToolbar`
 * and bound here to the dock store. Opening a dock that has no tabs yet lands on its picker
 * (choose what to open there); everything element-specific — the tab strips, each dock's "+"
 * menu, the pickers — lives on the dock surfaces themselves (features/dock).
 *
 * The pending-approval amber dot rides the toggle of the dock that holds the agents tab
 * (the right one while the panel is closed — the default edge panels open on), keeping a
 * nested approval discoverable while the panel is off screen.
 *
 * The new-chat draft has no toolbar, and the one panel it has a use for is Files, on the folder
 * picked there: `FilesPanelToggle` is the same toggle, for that one panel, beside the draft's
 * Workspace pill.
