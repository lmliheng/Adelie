/**
 * Makes the links in the Markdown below Workspace-aware: a link naming a file of `workspace` opens
 * it through `onOpenFile` (the Files panel) instead of a new tab — see lib/reply-link.ts for how an
 * href is sorted. With no `onOpenFile` the links keep the package's default, a new tab for every
 * link.
 *
 * Only a conversation provides it (MessageStream); every other surface — Memory, the handbook,
 * tickets — renders without it and keeps a new tab for every link. The resolver is memoized on its
 * two inputs: a context change re-renders every link in the transcript, memoized message bodies
 * included, so `onOpenFile` has to be a stable callback.
