/**
 * A Project's scheduled tasks, as a tiny module-level store shared by the two surfaces that read
 * them: the session list's alarm-clock mark (which of the listed Sessions have a task still to
 * fire) and the dock's scheduled-tasks panel (the open conversation's own tasks, listed). They
 * must never disagree about whether a conversation has tasks, so they read one cache rather than
 * fetching one each.
 *
 * The scope is the whole Project because that is what the two surfaces need between them: the
 * session list draws every Agent's Sessions — workspace, time and agent grouping all mix them —
 * while the panel is one conversation of one of them. Read per agent, the list answered only the
 * panel: every other Agent's rows wore no mark, and because the chat page moves the current Agent
 * to whatever conversation is open, the marks left one Agent's rows and returned to them as the
 * user walked the list. One Project-wide listing answers both surfaces, so a row's mark no longer
 * depends on which Agent is current.
 *
 * The server has no per-Session schedule field and no push channel for the schedule directories —
 * an agent may write a task file at any moment — so the store decides *when* to look: on
 * navigation (the Project or the Session on screen changing), whenever the window regains focus
 * while a reader is mounted, on the `schedule_fired` / `schedule_queued` events (wired in
 * state/sessions.tsx), on the panel's slow poll while it is on screen, after every mutation the
 * panel makes, and on the edge where a turn settles (chat-page.tsx) — a turn may have written a
 * task file of its own.
 *
 * Entries are kept per Project rather than held in a single slot the store points at, and none is
 * ever evicted: switching Projects and back then draws the marks on the first frame instead of
 * blanking them for the length of a round trip. Growth is bounded by how many Projects one
 * sitting opens, and an entry is a list already loaded once, so dropping one would trade a few
 * kilobytes back for exactly the blank-then-refetch this cache exists to remove.
