/**
 * Trace file view (reworked):
 * grouped by **round (Task)** — a global summary at the top; below it, one
 * group per Task, with the card's top-right corner showing that round's stats
 * and a **context-usage donut ring** (upper bound = the session's context
 * window, default 128000; the three segments are cacheRead / cacheWrite /
 * output, showing both usage ratio and composition, with exact numbers on
 * hover), followed by that round's execution timeline and all of its messages.
 *
 * Token usage here is **broken down by category** rather than given as one
 * lump sum (a total alone doesn't show where the money went): this round's
 * input (with the portion that was a **cache hit** in parentheses, target
 * icon, hover shows the hit rate = cache hit ÷ input), this round's output,
 * plus tool-call count / cost / duration / output TPS. The conversation
 * page's stats row only gives input/output totals — cache composition and
 * this kind of debugging detail belongs here. Every figure, cost included, is
 * the server's: the analysis prices each round with the cost center's rule,
 * so the file's total is what the toolbar shows for the same requests.
 *
 * Task attribution: model segments/tool spans carry their own taskIndex
 * (computed by the server), and messages fall into a Task's time range by
 * timestamp. Timeline ↔ message linked highlighting: hovering either side
 * highlights the other (only one bar / one message lights up at a time);
 * clicking a bar scrolls to the corresponding message and pins the highlight for PIN_MS.
