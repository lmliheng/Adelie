 * Sequential pager for a Trace file's events (pure — unit-tested in test/trace-events-loader.test.ts).
 *
 * The events endpoint is paginated and its `limit` is capped server-side, while the analysis
 * beside it describes the WHOLE file: every round carries a `messageFrom`/`messageTo` index
 * range, so a view that fetched one page only had nothing to show for any round whose range
 * started past that page — the last rounds of a long file, the compaction round among them.
 * The walk here is what closes that gap: it keeps asking for the next page until the file is
 * covered, reporting each page as it arrives so the first one is on screen while the rest load.
 *
 * Pages are fetched one at a time rather than in parallel: the file is read from disk in order,
 * the next offset is only known from the page before it (a page may come back short), and a
 * reader looking at round one does not benefit from round nine's page racing it.

 * Walk a Trace file's events from its start, reporting every page through `onPage`.
 *
 * The next offset is the end of what has actually been delivered (`offset + events.length`),
 * never `offset + pageSize`: the last page of a file is short, and any page the server answers
 * with fewer events than were asked for must not leave a hole behind it either. The walk ends
 * when that offset reaches the LATEST page's `total` — read per page, so a file appended to
 * while the walk runs is followed to its new end rather than cut at the length it had when the
 * first page was served.
 *
 * A page carrying no events also ends the walk, whatever its `total` claims: a file truncated
 * under the reader cannot be paged any further, and continuing would re-request the same offset
 * forever. Cancellation is checked on both sides of every await — after one, so a page that
 * arrives for a view that is gone is not rendered into it; before the next, so no further
 * request is issued once the caller has stopped caring about the answer.
 *
 * Rejections are not caught: the caller decides what a failed page means for what is already on
 * screen. Pages reported before it stand.
 *
 * Resolves with the `total` of the LAST page it reported — the walk's final word on how long the
 * file is, which a caller holding pages from an earlier walk uses to drop whatever sits past the
 * end. A walk that reported no page at all (cancelled before its first) resolves with 0, so the
 * caller must consult its own cancellation before acting on the number.
