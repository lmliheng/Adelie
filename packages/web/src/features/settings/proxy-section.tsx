/**
 * Proxy options (admin only, server-global). A form, not a live surface: two switches —
 * "Application uses the proxy" (the server's own outbound dispatcher) and "Agent environment
 * uses the proxy" (command subprocess environments) — share one proxy address, and nothing is
 * written until Save, which applies everything atomically via a single PUT. The server
 * validates and normalizes the address (bare "host:port" is stored as "http://host:port"); a
 * rejected address renders inline under the input and the atomic PUT writes nothing. Save with
 * no modifications sends no request and toasts "no changes"; a successful save takes effect
 * without a restart.
 *
 * Settings hydrate when the section mounts — which is every time it is navigated to — and the
 * controls and Save stay disabled until they arrive. The saved response is adopted as the new
 * baseline, including the address in the exact form the server stored, so the page reflects
 * what is on the server rather than what was typed at it.
 *
 * The reachability test sits BELOW the save row, in its own block, because it measures the
 * SAVED configuration: only a PUT moves the server's outbound dispatcher, so a typed-but-unsaved
 * address is not in the path the probes travel. Reading top to bottom — edit, save, then
 * measure — is what makes that honest without a warning banner. A save clears results that now
 * describe a superseded configuration.
 *
 * One request per target, fired together and rendered as each lands. A single response carrying
 * all of them would hold every row blank until the slowest answered, which for a host that
 * black-holes connections is the full five-second timeout with five working results behind it.
 *
 * It carries its own busy flag rather than borrowing Save's: a measurement is not an unsaved
 * edit, so it neither blocks Save nor is blocked by it.
 *
 * The targets — name and exact URL — come from the server and are listed before anyone presses
 * the button, so the page shows concretely what will be requested and a reader can see that
 * these are plain unauthenticated GETs. A frontend copy of that list could drift from the URLs
 * the server really fetches, so it is fetched, not hard-coded.
