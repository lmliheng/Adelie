/**
 * Company mode (admin only, server-global): one switch that applies the moment it is flipped —
 * a single PUT to /api/admin/settings, no Save button, and so no draft state to lose. The switch
 * is off on a server nobody has turned it on, which is why the pre-hydration state below is off
 * rather than on; it stays disabled until the stored value arrives and again while a write is in
 * flight, so a second flip cannot race the first. Off stops the organization scheduler, 404s
 * every organization route and hides the mode switch for everyone; on again resumes without
 * backfilling what was missed, and only brings the mode switch back — nobody's shell moves into
 * company mode by it (state/company.tsx). A write that fails puts the switch back on the stored
 * value and names the reason on a line under it (a toast would leave the switch and the message
 * on separate surfaces). The auth context is refreshed afterwards because the shell reads the
 * flag from /api/me, not from this page. The mode is a beta; the line under the switch says so
 * wherever the switch stands.
