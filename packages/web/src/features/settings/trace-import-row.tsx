/**
 * Trace import (Settings → General): a `.jsonl` Trace exported from another install
 * becomes a conversation of the chosen Agent.
 *
 * Both halves of the destination are picked here, Project included. The endpoint is
 * per-Agent and a Trace file cannot name one: its `session_meta` carries an `agent_state`
 * path belonging to the machine that exported it. The Project is asked for rather than
 * inherited because this dialog does not show which one is current — every other row in it
 * belongs to the account or the server — and an import that silently landed in whichever
 * Project the sidebar happened to have selected would be a hard mistake to notice. It also
 * means a Trace can be imported into a Project other than the open one, as long as the viewer
 * owns it: importing is the owner's, so the picker lists owned Projects only, and a viewer who
 * owns none gets no row.
 *
 * The row sits beside the CLI-sessions filter because both decide what the conversation
 * list holds. Export is deliberately not here: a Trace is downloaded from the conversation
 * it belongs to, in the chat's Trace panel.
