/**
 * What the id field does with the id a proposal just handed it (pure, unit tested): what goes
 * in the box, and what the field says about it.
 *
 * `POST /suggest-id` always answers with a valid id, so the field's job is not
 * to report a refusal but to say how much the id it just received is worth. A model-made id
 * needs no note at all. A transliteration of the display name gets a quiet one, because it is
 * a mechanical reading of what the user typed rather than a name anyone chose. A placeholder
 * gets an attention-toned one: it names nothing, it says why the two real paths produced
 * nothing, and it asks to be replaced before the dialog is submitted.
 *
 * A `reason` this build does not know (a newer server) still renders a sentence — the note is
 * how the user learns the id in the box is a placeholder, and losing it over an unrecognized
 * code would be the worse failure.
