/**
 * The id field every create dialog that names an object with a semantic id wears — a Project's,
 * an Agent's, a Benchmark's, an organization's and a channel's. The id is still required and
 * still validated by the caller (each kind has its own rule and its own error copy), but it no
 * longer has to be invented: the field carries a "generate" button that asks the server to
 * propose one from the display name (or, when nothing else names the thing yet, from the
 * mission or the description), which is why the name is the field above it.
 *
 * The proposal REPLACES whatever is in the box: the button is pressed to get an id, not to
 * get a suggestion beside the one already typed. It is unavailable while there is no text to
 * derive from and while a request is in flight, and it always comes back with an id — a name
 * nothing could translate gets a placeholder, and the note under the field says so and asks
 * for a real name, rather than a toast that would be gone by the time the user looks down.
 * Nothing is proposed on its own: typing a name never rewrites the id.
 *
 * The button says what it does in words — a model is asked for the id, which is not something
 * a sparkles glyph on its own tells anyone — so it sits BESIDE the box rather than inside it,
 * where a label would crowd the value it is meant to leave room for. What it must stay outside
 * of is the field's `<label>`: a `<button>` is a labelable element, so a wrapping label would
 * name the button instead of the input (the trap field.tsx documents). Hence the label row and
 * the hint are drawn here and the `Input` renders bare.
 *
 * A non-admin's Project id is `<username>-<suffix>` and only the suffix is typed: the fixed part
 * is drawn as `lockedPrefix` in front of the box, and a proposal (which the server returns whole)
 * fills in the part after it.
