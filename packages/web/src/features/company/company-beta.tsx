/**
 * Company mode says it is a beta, in the two shapes that fact takes in the shell.
 *
 * The tag — the package's `BetaBadge` in this app's words, a mini "Beta" mark riding at the
 * top-right of "Company" in the Development | Company work-mode switch, which is the one control
 * that names the mode itself and is in view on every page of both modes. The switch
 * (`Segmented`) pins it out of flow and folds its text into the option's accessible name.
 *
 * The notice — the sentence a person gets the first time they switch this browser into the
 * mode (state/company.tsx's `setWorkMode`), and the once-only decision behind it. The flag
 * lives in localStorage rather than in the user's preferences because it is about this
 * browser having shown a toast, not about the user: a second browser is a second first time,
 * and a preferences round trip would decide it too late to toast on the click that caused it.
