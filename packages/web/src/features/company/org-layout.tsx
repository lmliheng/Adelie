/**
 * The route shell of company mode. `/org` alone resolves to an organization (the one last
 * opened, else the first of the current Project, else the first anywhere) and opens its
 * overview, or, with none, renders an empty landing that offers creating one;
 * `/org/:projectId/:orgId/<page>` renders the page inside an organization context. Both fall
 * back to a Session's own page while company mode is unavailable — the admin master switch
 * off, or the user's own switch off — so a stale bookmark never shows an empty shell.
 *
 * Entering an organization's routes has three side effects the shell relies on: the work
 * mode flips to company (a deep link is a mode choice), the current Project follows the
 * route (the session list and the Agent set belong to the Project), and the organization
 * becomes the shell's current one (its channels and their badges, its desks, the switcher's
 * label) — and stays so after these routes unmount, since a desk conversation is one of the
 * organization's own surfaces even though it lives at `/chat/:sessionId`.
 *
 * The organization layout is also where the ticket dialog is mounted, once: a ticket's detail
 * is read in place from whichever surface named it — the board, the finance ledger, the
 * overview's inbox, a channel's reference — so the window belongs to the shell around the
 * pages rather than to any one of them.
 *
 * The page primitives live here too — `OrgPage` (the UI package's page frame and header at the
 * organization pages' width), `OrgEmptyLine` and the skeleton — so every organization page
 * shares one frame and one header row instead of each drawing its own; a page's sections are
 * the package's `RuledSection`.
