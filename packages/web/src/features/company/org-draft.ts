/**
 * The create-organization dialog's draft: what was typed, kept in localStorage so an
 * accidental close, a reload or a switch back to development mode does not lose a mission
 * someone spent minutes on. It is a DRAFT, not a preference — it is written on every edit,
 * restored when the dialog reopens and dropped the moment the organization is created (or
 * the user clears it).
 *
 * Scoped by user and by Project: two people on one browser must not see each other's draft,
 * and a draft belongs to the Project it was aimed at (its Workspace and model are that
 * Project's). Storage is injectable (work-mode.ts convention: vitest runs in Node with no
 * localStorage) and every read degrades to "no draft" rather than throwing at a dialog open.
