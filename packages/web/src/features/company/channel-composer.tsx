/**
 * A channel's composer: a growing textarea (Enter sends, Shift+Enter breaks the line, an
 * IME's accepting Enter never sends), the send button, and the `@` autocomplete — a portaled
 * panel above the box (through Dropdown's portal, so no ancestor's overflow clips it) listing
 * the channel's own members — employees with their titles, then people, then everyone —
 * ranked against what was typed (by id or by name), walked with the arrow keys and picked with
 * Enter or Tab. Escape dismisses the panel for that token until it changes.
 *
 * A pick writes the name the message will render (`@Ada Lovelace`), not the id the server
 * resolves: the draft tracks each picked mention as a range and the send converts it back
 * (mention-draft.ts has the rules). A mention is one block — an edit that reaches into it
 * takes all of it, and the caret steps over it — tinted the way a sent chip is by a layer
 * drawn behind the transparent textarea: the same box, font and wrapping, with the text itself
 * invisible, so only the tint shows through and the textarea keeps native caret, selection,
 * IME and undo.
 *
 * The browser's undo stack is why the block's edits are made the way they are. A value written
 * from script leaves that stack stale: Ctrl+Z then does nothing, and a redo can bring back text
 * from before the write.
 *
 * - Backspace at a mention's end and Delete at its start are replaced, before the browser acts,
 *   by a native delete of the whole mention — one step on that stack, so Ctrl+Z restores it.
 * - Any other edit that reaches into a mention (a word delete, a keyboard app's edit) is widened
 *   after the fact and written back, which costs the undo steps before it.
 * - An undo or redo is never written back. It restores only text, so when that text is one the
 *   draft held with mentions, a short history puts the mentions back.
 * - Nothing is written back while an input method is composing, since that breaks the
 *   composition; the widening waits for compositionend.
 *
 * The clipboard carries a mention as its name, which notifies nobody. So a copy, a cut or a drag
 * of text that holds mentions also writes them in a clipboard type of this app's own, and a
 * paste or a drop of that text puts them back once the box has inserted it: the insertion stays
 * the browser's own, and so does its undo step. A cut deletes its selection itself, natively,
 * since writing the clipboard means cancelling the browser's cut.
 *
 * The keys are named in the placeholder and nothing is rendered under the box, the way
 * development mode's chat input reads: a line of hint below the composer is read once and
 * then costs a row of the stream on every later visit.
