/**
 * One dock surface (dock-state.ts owns the arrangement): a tab strip across the top and
 * the active tab's body below — or, while the open dock has no tabs, a centered picker
 * choosing what to open here. The chat page renders one per open dock — right and/or
 * bottom — or a single merged bottom surface below the desktop breakpoint.
 *
 * The drawing is the UI package's (`DockFrame`, `DockTabs`, `DockPicker`); this container
 * binds it to the dock store, the terminal list and the panel registry.
 *
 * Panel tabs' bodies are the registry's (panel-registry.ts: the page registers one definition
 * per panel, body included, and this surface never names a panel itself), each wrapped in the
 * provider that tells it about its own tab (panel-context.tsx). A tab whose id has no definition
 * registered — a plugin's panel before the plugin loads — shows a placeholder saying so and keeps
 * its × until the definition arrives. Terminal tabs' bodies are the pooled xterm views
 * (terminal-view-pool.tsx), adopted by DOM handoff so tab churn never reconnects a shell.
 * Every tab's body stays mounted while its tab is in the strip — switching tabs hides and
 * shows, and so does hiding the whole dock (which renders at zero size rather than
 * unmounting), so a panel keeps its scroll, its drill-down and its unsaved text — except
 * terminal views, which the pool keeps only for shown terminals (an off-screen shell
 * reattaches on return).
 *
 * The header carries the strip, a "+" menu (panels, a fresh shell, and any live shell no
 * conversation holds), a detach button while a terminal is shown, a move-to-other-edge
 * button, a fullscreen toggle, and the dock's × (hide — tabs and everything their bodies hold
 * stay; each tab's own always-visible × is what removes). Tabs drag sideways to reorder;
 * dragging a tab out of the strip brings up the edge overlay (dock-drag.tsx) and dropping on
 * the other edge moves that tab there. Dragging the header itself moves the whole dock the same
 * way. The boundary with the chat content resizes the dock — the right dock through the shared
 * side-panel width, the bottom dock through its height ratio.
 *
 * FULLSCREEN is the surface grown as far as its own edge goes, the toolbar above it staying in
 * view: the right dock covers its row — the conversation beside it, with the bottom dock still
 * showing below — and the bottom dock (or the narrow merged view) climbs to the toolbar, over the
 * row and the right dock in it (the store says which surface, if any; the frame draws it, keeping
 * the dock's own box in the flow so nothing underneath reflows, and animates the flip with the
 * theme's layout motion). The strip, the "+" menu and the detach button keep working; what has no
 * meaning for a surface grown past its edge is put away — the move button, the header drag,
 * dragging a tab out to the other edge. The boundary drag is how the flip happens by gesture:
 * pulled past the dock's maximum size by a small slack, the dock snaps to fullscreen and the drag
 * is over; while fullscreen the handle sits on the cover's leading edge, and a pull back inward
 * past the slack (or a double click) snaps it back to its stored size. The header's toggle (now
 * corners in) is the other way back, and the store drops fullscreen by itself when the surface
 * stops qualifying (hidden, emptied, or a dock it covers brought forward). Esc is left alone: the
 * terminal, the editor and web pages each own it.
