/**
 * The registry of dock panel kinds: one self-describing definition per kind — its id, how it is
 * named and drawn, where it sorts, whether it is offered here, and the component that renders its
 * tab's body — read by every surface that lists, names or renders panels: the dock's tab strip,
 * its "+" menu and its picker, the floating launcher's fan, and the toolbar's panel buttons.
 *
 * Why a registry rather than a list of kinds: the dock is meant to take panels from plugins, and
 * a plugin's panel must be able to arrive without the dock knowing it by name. Everything the
 * dock used to do per kind through switches — a label here, a glyph there, a body in the chat
 * page — is a field of the definition now, and the built-ins register through the same door the
 * plugins will use (features/chat/builtin-dock-panels.tsx). Loading plugins is not here; this is
 * the seam they will plug into.
 *
 * An id doubles as the tab's stored key, so a stored tab whose definition is not registered (a
 * plugin's panel before the plugin loads, or after it was removed) still has a name and a mark
 * through `panelLabel` / `panelGlyphPath` — the id itself and the puzzle piece. The dock keeps
 * such a tab and shows a placeholder body until the definition arrives.
 *
 * `offered` is a live question — the built-in browser is offered only in the desktop app's own
 * window, which the shell answers a moment after startup — so a definition brings its own change
 * feed and the registry folds every feed into the one subscription. A feed is followed from the
 * moment of registration, not from the first subscriber: the built-ins register at module load,
 * before any component is mounted to listen, and their later `offered` flips must still reach it.
