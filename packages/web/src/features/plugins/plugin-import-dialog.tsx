/**
 * The plugin library's two import actions — a local zip upload and a remote download — with the
 * Modal and the overwrite confirmation they need, kept out of plugins-page.tsx so the page
 * keeps describing the library rather than the dialogs.
 *
 * Both are the same import twice: one carries the archive in the request, the other a URL the
 * server fetches, and everything after the POST is shared — a 409 `plugin_exists` opens the
 * overwrite confirmation, whose confirm resends THAT request with `overwrite: true` (so the
 * user never picks the file twice, nor retypes the name), and any other failure rolls back to a
 * toast. The library list and the directory line are re-read on success, which is how the new
 * card appears.
 *
 * Each dialog carries the same optional name field, for the one case the archive cannot answer
 * itself: plugin.json at the very root of the zip has no directory to take a name from. Left
 * empty — the normal case — nothing is sent, and the server names the plugin after the
 * directory inside the archive that carries plugin.json. The field is held to the server's own
 * name rule while it is typed, so a name the route would answer 400 for cannot reach the
 * submit button.
 *
 * The rules (see PluginRules) sit behind one link at the foot of each dialog instead of opening
 * under it: two numbered lists of prose, one about what an import takes and one about what a
 * plugin has to be, are reference material for whoever is about to publish one — not something
 * to read every time a plugin is installed, and as a panel it pushed the fields and the confirm
 * button off the screen. The link keeps them one click away, in the same two blocks.
 *
 * Admin-only by the server's own rule: the plugin directory is a server-level resource shared
 * by every Project, so a member cannot write into it — the caller (plugins-page) renders this
 * component only for an admin, and the routes answer 403 `admin_required` regardless.

 *
 * The import list is ORDERED because its last two entries are a precedence rather than a set of
 * facts: the plugin name is typed name first, then the name the source carries, then the
 * archive's own layout — and a GitHub REPOSITORY url is a source that carries the repository's
 * name, which is how a plugin can install under a name nobody asked for. That is the rule this
 * panel exists to put in front of the reader, at the moment they are about to name the thing.
 *
 * The authoring list is here for the same reason the panel is not in any one plugin repository:
 * a plugin outlives the repository it was published in, and the rules it states — no account
 * details, no credentials inside a plugin — are the ones its own author breaks, while looking at
 * this surface rather than at that repository's README.
 *
 * Exported for its own test (test/plugin-import-rules.test.ts): the dialogs around it render
 * through a portal and cannot be mounted in the suite's node environment, while this panel can.
