/**
 * One-click sync of the Project model table with the built-in catalog ("sync presets" next
 * to the search box): union semantics — catalog entries not configured locally are added,
 * and an entry present on both sides has its catalog facts brought back in line while the
 * fields describing this installation's own deployment are left exactly as they are.
 *
 * That split is the whole rule, and it runs along one question: does the catalog know the
 * answer better than the user does?
 *
 * - **Catalog facts** — context window, the three price buckets, the protocol pin, the vision
 *   flag, and the promotion — describe the model itself, so the catalog wins wherever the two
 *   differ. Missing catalog pricing removes local pricing, and a missing catalog promotion
 *   removes the stored one. The protocol pin is the reason this direction matters: re-syncing
 *   is how a built-in row saved before the catalog pinned its protocol gets repaired.
 * - **Deployment fields** — base URL, API key, output cap, fast mode — say how this install
 *   reaches the model, and nothing in the catalog can know them. A sync never overwrites one.
 *   An empty base URL is the single exception, and it is a fill rather than a reset: see
 *   {@link baseUrlFill}.
 *
 * Locally added models (including user-defined groups) are kept untouched. A retired catalog
 * entry (see `ModelCatalogEntry.retired`) is never added, but one configured locally has its
 * facts updated like any other preset, which is what keeps its stored price on the catalog's.
 * Credentials are never touched: merged rows carry no apiKey input (the PUT keeps the stored
 * key) and existing rows keep their credential display state.
 *
 * The price a sync writes is the catalog's list price; the promotion running on it is stored by
 * the server outside the config file, which is why it travels as a declaration rather than as a
 * field — see {@link catalogPromotion}, which also covers the Penguin Go group it leaves alone.
 * The display name is filled but never overwritten, on the same terms as the base URL — see
 * {@link displayNameFill}.

 * better than the person who typed it. Overwriting a stored one takes the model offline and
 * leaves no trace of what it used to be, so a sync never does.
 *
 * An empty field is a different situation: there is nothing to destroy, and on the rows the
 * catalog carries a URL for the empty state is far more likely damage than intent. A gateway
 * group and a `custom`-group preset (Atria) reach nothing without one, because neither the
 * group nor the protocol implies an endpoint — such a row is simply broken until something puts
 * the URL back, and a sync is the one thing that knows it. Filling it in is therefore the same
 * repair the name fill performs, at the same cost: a base URL deliberately cleared comes back on
