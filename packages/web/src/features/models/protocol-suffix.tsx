/**
 * The protocol control that lives INSIDE the right edge of the config dialog's base URL
 * field — it is the grey protocol-path suffix that field always had, promoted from a
 * passive label into the protocol picker itself.
 *
 * The suffix already displayed the very thing this control selects: the path the AgentHub
 * client appends to the base URL (`/responses` / `/v1/messages` / `/chat/completions`),
 * which is one-to-one with the three generic protocol clients. So protocol selection
 * reuses that component rather than occupying a form row of their own: the trigger keeps
 * showing the live path, and clicking it opens a menu of the three protocols (name as the
 * row title, the appended path as its description) — the manual override.
 *
 * Selection only. The detect ACTION lives at the base URL field's top-right, next to its
 * label (per maintainer: same placement idiom as the API key field's "get API key" link),
 * because detection is gated on the API key and a disabled menu row cannot carry that
 * reason where the user is looking. This menu still *reflects* a run in progress — the
 * trigger spins, and an inconclusive run tints it amber — since the value being determined
 * is the one it displays.
 *
 * Built on the shared Dropdown primitive in portal mode, which is what makes this safe
 * inside a Modal at phone widths: the panel is mounted on document.body at fixed viewport
 * coordinates (no ancestor overflow can clip it), clamped to stay on-screen, flipped up
 * when there is no room below, capped to the room it does have, and wired into the shared
 * Escape-layer stack plus arrow-key navigation.
 *
 * State is rendered without ever changing the trigger's width, so the in-field padding the
 * base URL input reserves for it never has to move: "detecting" swaps the chevron for a
 * spinner of the same box, and the warning state (nothing matched / detection failed) is
 * colour-only. The message itself goes in the base URL field's own text slot below — see
 * the call site — so no extra row appears in the happy path.
