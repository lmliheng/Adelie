/**
 * Model config page.
 *
 * Model entries are persisted as two independent fields, `provider` and `model_id`;
 * the (provider, model_id) pair is the entry's unique key — **zero
 * concatenation** anywhere in the pipeline, `model_id` is sent to AgentHub verbatim as the
 * upstream request id. The dialog's identity section = (group dropdown, upstream id input);
 * changing either one is a rename, submitted as a paired `renamedFrom` (the server uses it
 * to migrate the credential and pointers).
 *
 * The list is purely for "finding a model": grouped by vendor (group header = logo + vendor
 * name + count + the collapse chevron), with one card per model within a group — the card
 * shows only the display name + status badges (default / vision / fast / free / discount), while
 * context, pricing, and key status are folded into a single line of small text. Clicking a card opens the config dialog
 * (credentials, context, pricing, vision toggle, plus set as default / set as vision model /
 * delete). The group header's right side holds the group's actions in a fixed order
 * (group-header.ts): its balance (pin and refresh before the amount, a divider after it),
 * Connect with its status, Enter key, the speed test, and — on the groups that take
 * hand-added models (custom, vLLM, user-defined) — Add model, which reuses the same dialog
 * with that group pre-filled. The protocol follows group semantics: custom / user-defined
 * groups pick or detect it, a group that pins one (vLLM) hands it to every entry. The "get
 * model id / API key" external links sit next to the corresponding input's label in the
 * dialogs, never in the header. Nothing is pitched above the groups: a group carries its own
 * Connect action (with a status dot), and that is the one entry to authorizing it. The group
 * list ends with an "add group" action (user-defined
 * groups share custom's semantics; the group appears once the first model saves successfully —
 * groups are carried by the model entry's provider field, not persisted separately). The
 * header also holds an owner-only "sync presets" action next to the search box (union-merge
 * with the built-in catalog, see catalog-sync.ts).
 *
 * Saving does a PUT full-table replace (models not present are deleted; an empty apiKey
 * means keep the existing value); only the owner can edit.

 * Whether the model dialog offers the fast-mode switch for a draft row, and on which protocol
 * the parameter would travel.
 *
 * `protocol` is AgentHub's own answer (see fastModeProtocol): `undefined` means the routed
 * client rejects `fast_mode` — or the id routes to no client at all — so arming the switch
 * could only produce a turn-killing error, and it is not offered. `show` adds the one
 * exception: a row that already stores fast mode keeps its switch regardless, because a
 * value that arrived another way (a hand-edited config, `penguin config model add
 * --fast-mode`, or an upstream id renamed afterwards) has to remain switchable off — the
 * runtime rejection tells the user to turn it off in the model settings, and that has to be
 * true. `protocol` also picks the warning copy: only Anthropic's fast mode is a gated
 * research preview.
 *
 * The client type is resolved through protocolForPersist — the one the entry will actually
 * be SAVED with — rather than the raw field, for the same reason envHintClientType exists: a
 * custom-like group leaves the protocol empty until detection or a manual pick fills it in,
 * and fastModeProtocol then falls back to routing by model id. Typing an id that routes to a
 * client with no fast tier (`kimi-k3`, `gemini-3-pro`) into a custom group would hide a
 * switch that the persisted `openai-chat` entry can in fact serve. An empty result keeps the
 * id-based routing the preset and vendor groups genuinely use.

 * "Add group" in two modes, chosen under the name field:
 *
 * - **Create only** — the light path: a valid name hands off to that group's add-model
 *   dialog (groups are carried by model entries, so the group appears once the first
 *   model saves; canceling leaves nothing behind).
 * - **Import models** — fills the brand-new group from its endpoint, in the add-model
 *   dialog's field rhythm: API key first, then the base URL with the detect action at its
 *   top-right and the in-field protocol picker as manual override (ProtocolSuffixMenu —
 *   the same one-to-one path menu). Only once a protocol is determined (detected or
 *   picked) does the "import all models" action appear; it lists the endpoint
 *   (POST models/list) and hands the appended rows to the page for one table PUT.
 *
 * Detection failure turns the suffix amber and keeps both ways out usable — pick the
 * protocol by hand, or switch back to create-only. Errors render inside the dialog;
 * nothing persists until a listing succeeded.

            baseUrlRequired). The in-field suffix at the right edge shows the protocol path the
            client appends to the base URL — the endpoint shape a custom URL must serve; it
            renders for every model and stays while the field is empty (hints the shape before
            typing). It looks like the unit affix of the context window / max tokens fields
            below, but it can be a menu button, which Input's `affix` does not take, so it is
            positioned by hand and the error text sits outside the relative wrapper (see
            Input.invalid).

            For custom / user-defined groups that suffix IS the protocol SELECTOR (see
            protocol-suffix.tsx): the path is one-to-one with the three generic protocol
            clients, so picking one reuses it instead of taking a form row of its own.
            Elsewhere (preset groups, read-only viewers) it stays the plain grey label it has
            always been.

            The detect ACTION sits at this field's top-right instead, next to the label — the
            same idiom as the API key field's "get API key" link above (per maintainer). It is
            gated on the API key, and a disabled row buried inside the suffix menu could not
            say so where the user is looking.

            A <div>, not a <label>: the picker is a <button>, and a label may not contain a
            second labelable element besides its control — the click would fire the button AND

            wraps inside its half-width cell rather than overflowing. Each switch is optional,
