/**
 * Tells the desktop shell which language the window is in, so its tray menu reads the same way.
 *
 * The shell cannot see this preference itself: it lives in this browser's localStorage, on the
 * other side of a boundary the desktop design keeps deliberately one-way — the window is a
 * plain browser with no IPC bridge into it. So the page reports, over the same
 * `PUT /api/desktop/tray` the Appearance switch uses, and the shell persists what it hears and
 * redraws its menu.
 *
 * Reports on mount as well as on change: the shell starts before any window loads and falls
 * back to the device language until something tells it otherwise, which is the wrong answer for
 * anyone who has picked a language that is not their device's.
 *
 * A failed report is dropped. There is no retry and no message: the tray is a convenience, the
 * next language change (or the next launch of the app, which sends again on mount) will carry
 * the value, and a toast about a menu the user may not even have open would be noise.
