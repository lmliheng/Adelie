/**
 * Company-mode shell state: whether the mode is available at all, which mode the shell is
 * in, which organization is open, the organizations this user can reach, the open
 * organization's channels, and the live counters their badges show.
 *
 * Availability is two switches ANDed: the server's master switch (`MeResponse.companyMode`,
 * read through the auth context) and the user's own (`UiPrefs.companyMode`, default on). Off
 * on either side, the shell renders no mode switch and every `/org` route falls back to a
 * Session's own page; organizations keep running regardless — the personal switch only hides the
 * user's own view of them.
 *
 * Turning a switch on only offers the mode: the mode switch appears, and the shell stays in
 * development on the page it is showing. The store holds that by keeping the chosen mode at
 * development while company mode is unavailable — a stored "company" is written back the moment
 * the store sees either switch off, whether the switch goes off in this tab, was already off at
 * load, or the preferences holding the choice arrive while it is. A choice kept through the off
 * spell would take effect when the switch comes back on, swapping in the company sidebar under
 * whatever page is open (the new-chat page, say) instead of the company landing. Company mode is
 * entered only by the user: the mode switch, or an `/org` route.
 *
 * Entering company mode is also where the shell says the mode is a beta: the first switch
 * into it in a browser raises the notice once (features/company/company-beta.tsx keeps the
 * flag), which is why `setWorkMode` is the single handler both mode switches call.
 *
 * The chosen mode and the organization last opened are user preferences (`workMode`,
 * `lastOrgKey` in ui_prefs) mirrored into localStorage (lib/work-mode.ts) so a reload stands
 * in the right mode before the preferences arrive; the stored copy wins once it does. Both
 * the open and the remembered organization are forgotten once a complete listing comes back
 * without them: a deleted organization that keeps the shell aimed at it costs a broken
 * sidebar on every later visit.
 *
 * The open ticket lives here too. A ticket's detail is a dialog opened in place from every
 * company surface — the board, the finance ledger, the overview's inbox, a channel's ticket
 * reference — so which ticket is open is shell state rather than one page's, and the single
 * host (features/company/org-layout.tsx) renders whatever this says. Following a parent or a
 * child inside the dialog pushes the ticket left behind onto a stack, which is what the
 * dialog's back control pops.
 *
 * Company events ride the same user-level event stream the session list consumes
 * (state/sessions.tsx forwards them through `publishCompanyEvent`): the store keeps the
 * channel counters of the open organization in step and bumps a version per event family,
 * which the pages watch to refetch — the query routes carry the durable state, the events only say
 * that it moved.
 *
 * State lives in a zustand vanilla store (one instance per Provider mount) like the Project
 * and Session stores; the Provider is the lifecycle component that hydrates it.
