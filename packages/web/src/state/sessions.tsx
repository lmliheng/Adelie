/**
 * Session list context for all Agents in the current Project:
 * the sidebar groups by Agent, so all Agents' Sessions are loaded at once (fetched in parallel);
 * the chat page shares this same data for status sync / title events / self-healing reload.
 *
 * **Paged per (Agent, category)**: the default load fetches only the **active** category
 * (a person's conversations, non-archived) plus per-category totals — background (API,
 * scheduled, subagent and CLI) and archived Sessions are not loaded until their collapsed
 * folder is opened. Each pair fetches
 * SIDEBAR_PAGE_SIZE sessions per page (requesting one extra to detect "has more" — see
 * splitPage); `loadMoreFor` fetches a pair's first page when unloaded and the next page
 * otherwise, so every category's paging is independent of the others. A reload resets each
 * **loaded** pair back to its first page (an open folder must not blank on an event-triggered
 * refresh) and leaves unopened folders unloaded.
 *
 * **Activity order, cursor paging**: every page is asked for in the sidebar's own display order
 * (`order=activity`: last activity first) and continues from the key of the last row read
 * (`before=`), never from an offset — activity reorders the list while it is read, and an
 * offset would skip a row that moved above it. A row that moves above a cursor is not served
 * again; a loaded one moves in place on its `session_state`, and an unloaded one is fetched
 * on it (adoptLiveSession), which is what keeps the pages complete. A list merged from several
 * streams (Agents, machines) shows only the rows above its watermark (watermarkFor; the
 * sidebar cuts at it), so a later page can only ever add rows below the ones on screen.
 *
 * **Own rows only**: every fetch asks the server for the user's own conversations
 * (`excludeOrg`), and no category holds a company Session anyway, so an organization's desk,
 * ticket and sub-sessions are in neither the rows nor the totals the sidebar builds its groups
 * from. One can still enter through `add()` (the
 * chat page's deep-link self-heal): the sidebar drops it at render (withoutOrgSessions), the
 * totals are left alone for it, and a reload carries it over. Live statuses are remembered for
 * EVERY `session_state` the user channel reports (`liveStatuses`), row or no row — company
 * mode's surfaces read them for the Sessions this list deliberately does not fetch
 * (useLiveSessionStatuses).
 *
 * **Sessions are not auto-created here**: a new conversation starts as a draft (chat page `/chat/new`),
 * and the Session is only actually created when the first message is sent — after landing, the user
 * may still switch models or configure an API key first, so persisting the Session early would both
 * lock in the model and fail outright when no credential is configured yet.
 *
 * State lives in a zustand vanilla store (one instance per Provider mount); the Provider is a
 * thin lifecycle component (initial fetch, refetch on Project/Agent-set/filter changes, the
 * user-event subscription) and republishes the store's state through the same context value
 * as before. Mutations read current values via store.getState() (the old refs' job).

       * A status flip changes more of the row than the status, because the glyph is drawn from
       * three fields, not one (see session-activity.ts). The user-channel `session_state` event
       * carries the other two from the server's own row; the open Session's stream calls this
       * with two arguments, having none to give.
       *
       * - `lastActiveAt` is what makes a background completion legible: the read/unread split
       *   compares it against the seen marker (session-seen.ts), so without the server's new
       *   stamp a Session that finished while the user was elsewhere would settle into the
       *   muted "already read" glyph — the exact case the user needs to notice.
       * - `hasTrace` is what keeps a FIRST run from settling into nothing at all. It separates
       *   "finished" from "never ran", and a Session running its first Task still has the
       *   `false` its list row was fetched with: the hourglass shows (status wins), and then
       *   the moment it stops the row would go blank.
       *
       * `hasTrace` is therefore treated as monotonic, and a live status is itself proof the
       * Session has run — server-side it is a one-way cache (`has_trace = 1`, never cleared)
       * set at run start, and a running Session has by definition started a Task. That second
       * half is what keeps the two callers consistent: the Session stream carries no flag, so
       * on its own it would settle a first run into a blank row until the next list fetch.
       *
       * An id no loaded page holds is not turned into a row here: the event names a Session, it
       * does not describe one, and a row invented from a status and a timestamp would have no
       * title, Agent or Workspace to render. The user channel fetches such a row instead when
       * it is this Project's (applyUserEvent → adoptLiveSession). The STATUS is remembered
       * either way (`liveStatuses`): the user channel is the one source that reports a run
       * ending, and company mode reads it for the Sessions this list never fetches.
