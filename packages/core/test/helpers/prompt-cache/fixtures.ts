/**
 * The scenery the Session suites stand on: one agent, fake collaborators, and the assertion the
 * lifecycle scenarios share.
 *
 * `prompt-cache-invariants.test.ts` and `prompt-cache-lifecycle.test.ts` drive the same agent —
 * same tools, same system prompt, same model id — so the fixtures live here and each suite keeps
 * only what is its own. The system prompt is the size a real one is, because a fixed prefix under
 * the provider's minimum would turn every number the lifecycle suite reports into a statement
 * about the minimum instead of about the harness.
 *
 * The requests come from `recording.ts`, the numbers from `simulator.ts`, and the reason behind a
 * miss from `diagnostics.ts`. `expectHits` is where those meet: every request reads back the whole
 * prefix of its context's previous request, unless the scenario names the index and bounds the
 * loss itself.
