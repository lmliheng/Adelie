 * Drops the lines a sandbox runner prints on stderr before it execs the confined command

 * report on an older kernel, printed on every run. Only the HEAD of the stream is examined:
 * the runner writes before the exec, so once a line that is not one of them (or any byte that
 * cannot begin one) has passed, everything after is the command's own and flows untouched. A
 * command whose own FIRST stderr line is word for word one of them loses that line — the price
 * of not parsing the command's output.
