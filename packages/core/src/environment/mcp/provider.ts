/**
 * McpToolProvider — connects the configured MCP Servers and bridges their tools into
 * Environment as BuiltinTool instances.
 *
 * Naming: every MCP tool is exposed to the LLM as `mcp__<server>__<tool>`, which keeps the
 * flat tool namespace collision-free (builtin names never carry the prefix, and the server
 * name — validated to a safe alphabet — separates servers from each other).
 *
 * Lifecycle: connection and tool discovery are lazy and single-flight — `Environment.listTools()`
 * triggers a connect phase for every configured server that has no live connection; the
 * pending servers connect in parallel, each bounded by its `connectTimeoutMs`. A server that
 * fails to connect (or an invalid config entry) is reported as a stderr warning and skipped —
 * MCP problems never break Session creation, matching Environment's stance on unrecognized
 * builtin tool names. Discovery is a snapshot per connection: `tools/list_changed`
 * notifications are ignored. When a compaction opens the next model context, `reconfigure`
 * keeps every connection whose entry is unchanged (no respawn, no re-discovery), closes the
 * removed or changed ones, and leaves the new or changed ones pending for the next phase.
 *
 * Execution: a call is bridged to `client.callTool` with the Environment-merged abort
 * signal passed through. The SDK's own per-request timeout is pushed out of the way
 * (`MAX_SDK_TIMEOUT_MS`) so Environment stays the single timekeeper — its per-tool
 * `timeoutMs` (server entry override or Environment default) aborts the signal, which
 * cancels the in-flight request. Result content maps as: text blocks → output text; image
 * blocks → `images` data URLs; audio/binary-resource blocks → placeholder lines;
 * `structuredContent` is serialized only when no text block was present; `isError` →
 * `stopReason: "fatal"`. Permission for the frontend's read-only mode comes from the
 * spec's `readOnlyHint` annotation (`true` → `"r"`, anything else → `"rw"` — hints are
 * untrusted, so the default is the restrictive direction), unless the entry sets an
 * explicit `permission`, which then applies to every tool of that server.
 * Docs: /docs/tools § "MCP servers".
