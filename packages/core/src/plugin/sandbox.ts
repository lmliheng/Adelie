/**
 * The sandbox vocabulary a plugin compiles against — types only.
 *
 * It lives in core, alongside the rest of the plugin contract, because a backend is
 * written against these names and nothing else: a package implementing {@link
 * SandboxProvider} needs the policy it is handed and the argv it must return, not the
 * harness that routes them. The routing itself (which policy goes to which backend, and
 * the settings behind it) is the embedder's, and stays there.
 *
 * Confinement is argv rewriting and nothing else: a provider returns the argv the caller
 * should spawn instead of its own, and never executes anything itself.
 *
 * Nothing here emits runtime code. The helpers that read these shapes
 * (`SANDBOX_DIMENSIONS`, `providerDimensions`, `requestedDimensions`) are the embedder's
 * and live in the server package, so a plugin carries no runtime dependency on core.
 * A backend reaches the harness by contributing to the `sandbox.providers` slot (see
 * the sandbox module's iface.ts in the server package).
