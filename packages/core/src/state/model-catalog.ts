/**
 * Built-in model catalog (single source of truth): official chat models that AgentHub can
 * auto-route, shared by core's default config, server's initial config, and web/cli display.
 * Data verified as of 2026-07-10 (Qwen Token Plan entries: 2026-07-20; MiniMax: 2026-08-03;
 * DeepSeek, Gemini 3.7, GLM-5.3 and the whole OpenAI line-up (direct + OpenRouter):
 * 2026-08-18; the direct Anthropic group: 2026-08-20; the DeepSeek V4 Flash Vision Exp rows:
 * 2026-08-21; the TokenDance group: 2026-08-25, its glm-5.3-flash row: 2026-08-26, its
 * qwen3.8-flash row: 2026-08-27 and its running promotions plus the hy4-preview rows
 * (TokenDance + OpenRouter): 2026-08-28; the GLM-5.3 Flash rows (direct + OpenRouter) and
 * the direct qwen3.8-flash: 2026-08-26; the TokenDance Doubao Seed rows (seed-2.1-pro,
 * seed-2.1-turbo, seed-evolving): 2026-09-02; the vLLM group: 2026-09-03; the GPT-6 Astra
 * rows (direct + OpenRouter): 2026-09-09; the whole Gemini 3.x line-up, direct + OpenRouter —
 * the 3.6 / 3.7 / 3.8 Flash launch discounts declared, every other row re-read and unchanged:
 * 2026-09-09; the OpenRouter and TokenDance V4.1 Flash rows, and TokenDance's running
 * promotions plus its Doubao Seed display names: 2026-09-10; the Penguin Go resale lineup,
 * matched to the relay's current generic-client model export: 2026-09-11, its DeepSeek rows to
 * DeepSeek's own lineup: 2026-09-16; the OpenRouter z-ai/glm-5.3-flash row: 2026-09-16; and
 * the 2026-09-16 refresh — the direct DeepSeek group down to the two names its pricing page
 * lists, TokenDance's deepseek-v4-flash-0731 / deepseek-v4-pro-0813 / kimi-k3 promotions, the
 * OpenRouter qwen/qwen3.8-27b row, the Fireworks AI and SiliconFlow additions, and both Qwen
 * groups' line-ups with their peak/off-peak DeepSeek rows: 2026-09-16; the OpenCode Go group:
 * 2026-09-18 — per each provider's docs; and the ModelScope group, whose preset ids were read
 * from public model pages and endpoint listings — their windows, vision flags and prices are
 * NOT verified and say so on the rows themselves: 2026-09-18 and 2026-09-20).
 * Docs: packages/docs/content/models.{zh,en}.md (site path /docs/models) documents the
 * provider groups and credential resolution described here.
 *
 * Three-bucket pricing convention (USD per million tokens, matching usageToTokenCounts'
 * token-to-bucket mapping):
 * - cache_read: the vendor's "cache hit" price;
 * - cache_write: the vendor's "cache write" price (e.g. Anthropic uses 1.25 x input); vendors
 *   without a separate cache-write fee use the standard input price;
 * - output: output price (thinking + reply).
 * OpenAI charges extra for >272K input, Gemini 3.1 Pro for >200K input, and MiniMax M3 doubles
 * every rate above 512K input; this catalog records their base tier (the cost center uses a
 * single rate, so long-context usage will be underestimated).
 *
 * Scope: excludes deepseek-chat / deepseek-reasoner legacy aliases that AgentHub cannot
 * auto-route (deprecated 2026-07-24), glm-5v-turbo (AgentHub's GLM client forwards images
 * only for glm-5.3-flash, so a vision model cannot do the one thing it exists for), the
 * OpenRouter z-ai/glm-5.1 and SiliconFlow Pro/zai-org/GLM-5.1 gateway listings
 * (delisted 2026-08-06; the Z.AI direct glm-5.1 remains), the OpenRouter
 * inclusionai/ling-3.0-flash:free listing (delisted from OpenRouter, removed 2026-08-18),
 * non-chat models (embedding / image generation / TTS), and Bedrock. Direct-vendor ids are
 * auto-routed by AgentHub and leave client_type unset; seven gateway groups (OpenRouter,
 * Fireworks AI, SiliconFlow, TokenDance, OpenCode Go, Qwen Pay-As-You-Go and Qwen Token Plan)
 * can't be auto-routed, so every gateway row **always pins an explicit client_type** and
 * inlines its preset base URL. ModelScope's rows pin one protocol too (see below).
 * Two groups pin at GROUP level as well (ModelProviderInfo.clientType, read
 * through providerClientType), so that a model the user adds there speaks the same protocol
 * as the presets: vLLM, whose added models have no preset base URL to inherit either, and
 * OpenRouter, whose do — see each group's own block comment.
 * That pin is load-bearing, not decoration: AgentHub's AutoLLMClient matches raw substrings
 * against `client_type || model_id` and never looks at base_url, so an unpinned gateway id
 * would be routed by its own spelling — `openai/gpt-5.6-sol` would reach the first-party
 * GPT-5.6 client aimed at a gateway, and `anthropic/claude-opus-4.8` would throw outright
 * (dotted "4.8" matches neither "4-8" nor "-5"). Four protocols are pinned:
 * - `openai-responses` for every OpenRouter row: OpenRouter serves the Responses API for
 *   every upstream at the same base URL the rows already carry, and the group pins the same
 *   protocol so a user-added entry inherits it;
 * - `openai-chat` for the other OpenAI-compatible gateway rows (AgentHub 0.4.2's canonical
 *   name for the generic Chat Completions client — the bare "openai" spelling is a
 *   deprecated upstream alias, see canonicalClientType);
 * - `openai-chat-vllm-adapter` for the vLLM group, which is Chat Completions on the wire
 *   but maps the thinking level onto the served model's own chat template
 *   (VLLM_CLIENT_TYPE);
 * - `ant-messages` for the OpenCode Go rows its endpoint table serves on the Anthropic
 *   Messages API. That group pins row by row, since its models sit on three protocols: the
 *   rest of it is `openai-chat` and `openai-responses` — see its block comment.
 * ModelScope's rows all pin `openai-responses`: ModelScope serves every preset through its
 * OpenAI Responses endpoint, and the explicit pin keeps a Qwen or DeepSeek id from auto-routing
 * to a vendor client with a different request shape.
 *
 * Two direct-vendor rows pin anyway, because their own id does not route: the MiniMax M3
 * preset pins AgentHub's first-party `minimax-m3` protocol and direct API endpoint, and
 * `deepseek-flash` pins `deepseek-v4` because AgentHub 0.4.11 routes DeepSeek on that
 * substring alone and the released V4.1 Flash id no longer carries it.
 *
 * App attribution (`attributionHeaders`, bottom of this file) rides alongside the protocol
 * pins: it names Adelie to the gateways that read such a header, keyed on the
 * endpoint host rather than on the provider group.
 *
 * This file imports no Node built-ins (type-only imports only), so it can be bundled directly
 * for the browser.

  // Discounts: every row here stores the official LIST price, the convention of the two Qwen
  // groups below, and a promoted row declares its rate in `discount` rather than having its
  // price rewritten — a promotion that lapses is then one field to delete, with the rate to
  // return to still on the row. effectivePricing() applies it; a new Project stores the list
  // price and the fraction as a promotion beside it, which the cost center applies, so it
  // charges what the gateway charges.

  // kimi-k3 at 40% (seller's quote 2026-09-16); glm-5.3, glm-5.3-flash and qwen3.8-max at 10%
  // and the three Doubao Seed rows (seed-2.1-pro, seed-2.1-turbo, seed-evolving) at 50% (rates
  // re-confirmed 2026-09-10). One more row, deepseek-v4.1-flash, carries no flat discount at
  // all and instead follows the vendor's own peak/off-peak schedule (DEEPSEEK_OFF_PEAK),
  // storing the peak price the way the direct DeepSeek rows do; so does the retired
  // deepseek-v4-flash-vision-exp row, which is no longer a preset. The rest carry neither, so
  // for them list price and billed rate coincide.
  //
  // A running promotion usually also shows up without a credential: the catalog API opens
  // such a model's `description` with a bracketed 限时 ("limited-time") tag, so the same

  //
  // Protocol: the docs page's endpoint table puts each model on one path, and each row pins

  // /responses, both on OPENCODE_GO_BASE_URL, and `ant-messages` for /v1/messages on

  // glm-*, kimi-k3, kimi-k2.6, deepseek-v4* and minimax-m3 would reach their first-party
  // clients, and the other ids would not route at all. The gateway refuses a request that does
  // not name its conversation (400 "Request is missing x-opencode-session"), which
  // attributionHeaders does for this host on every request: a Session's requests carry its id,
  // and a request outside any Session — a connectivity test, a vision probe — a fresh one.
  //
  // Vision: from models.dev, and checked live on 2026-09-17 and 2026-09-18 by sending an image
  // of a number. Every vision row that could be reached read it back, and the text-only rows
  // refused the image or answered without seeing it. The rows below that could not be reached
  // keep models.dev's flag.
  //
  // Pricing: Go is a monthly subscription whose usage limits are dollar amounts. Each model has
  // a monthly allowance, capped at 20% per 5 hours and 50% per week. A request draws the
  // per-token rates the docs page publishes, and those are what the rows store. So the cost
  // center shows allowance spent, not an invoice, as with the Qwen Token Plan rows, which store
  // per-token list prices rather than the plan's fee. Where the page lists no cached-write rate,
  // cache_write carries the input rate. Four rows are tiered and store their base tier: GPT-5.6
  // Luna above 272K input tokens, Grok 4.6 above 200K, Qwen 3.7 Plus and Qwen 3.6 Plus above
  // 256K. The four DeepSeek rows publish a peak and an off-peak rate on DeepSeek's own windows
  // (peak 01:00-04:00 and 06:00-10:00 UTC on weekdays, i.e. DEEPSEEK_OFF_PEAK), off-peak
  // exactly half, so they store the peak rate and declare that schedule. DeepSeek V4.1 Flash's
  // running "4x" offer (ends 2026-09-20) raises its monthly allowance, not its rates, so no
  // row carries a `discount`.
  //
  // Account opt-in and region: five models answer 403 until the key's OpenCode workspace opts
  // in. The two Muse Spark Contributor models require consent to Meta training on prompts and
  // completions. deepseek-v4.1-flash, deepseek-v4-flash and deepseek-v4-pro require consent to
  // China-hosted serving. Some upstreams also refuse a caller's region: from a mainland China

  // Every row prices at zero, and omits two other things, all because the user runs the server:

  //   badge and contribute 0 to the cost center rather than the "unpriced" mark — which is the
  //   truthful reading of a self-hosted endpoint that bills nobody.
  // - **no base URL**. Every deployment has its own; the user supplies it, as in `custom`.
  // - **no auto-routing**. Each row pins openai-chat-vllm-adapter explicitly, and the pin is
  //   load-bearing twice over: `Qwen/*` matches none of AutoLLMClient's substring rules and
  //   would be rejected outright, while `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-*` contains "deepseek-v4"

  // contextWindow is the recipe's NATIVE length, which is the most a deployment can serve
  // without reconfiguration; an operator may serve less (`--max-model-len` below the native
  // limit) or, for the Qwen rows, far more with YaRN rope scaling. The catalog cannot know

 * answer is too. This mirrors AutoLLMClient's branch order exactly (the same discipline as
 * resolveModelEnv above) and reports what the selected client does with the parameter:
 *
 * - maps it -> the protocol, and the toggle may be offered;
 * - raises UnsupportedParameterError (gemini3_7, glm5_3, kimi_k3, deepseek_v4,
 *   openai_embedding, and claude5 on Bedrock or a Claude 4.6 id) -> `undefined`;
 * - routes nowhere (AutoLLMClient throws for an id it cannot place; there is no openai_chat
 *   fallback) -> `undefined` as well, since a model that cannot run has no fast tier either.
 *
 * A rule rather than a per-model list on purpose: catalog rows added later inherit the right
 * answer without anyone remembering to update a table.
 *
 * Routing reads `(clientType || modelId).toLowerCase()`, exactly as AutoLLMClient resolves it,
 * so an entry that pins no client_type self-routes on its model id - which does not always
 * agree with its provider group (`anthropic/claude-fable-5` with a blank client_type reaches
 * the native claude5 client, not openai_chat, and the dotted `anthropic/claude-opus-4.8`
 * matches no branch at all). The two claude5 carve-outs are therefore checked against the raw
 * `modelId` / `baseUrl`, not against the routing token: the client tests its own `_model` for
 * `"4-6"` and its base URL for the `bedrock://` prefix.
 *
 * `"anthropic"` is reported for every Claude the client serves, including ids outside the
 * research preview's Opus allowlist: Anthropic answers those with a 429 at request time, which
 * is something to warn about before enabling, not grounds to hide the setting.
 *
 * Two runtime inputs stay invisible to a pure function of the config and can still flip the
 * answer: the server's `CLIENT_TYPE` env var overrides the entry's client type, and
 * `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` supplies the base URL when the entry leaves it blank (so a `bedrock://`
 * there sends Claude to Bedrock, which has no fast tier). Third-party OpenAI-compatible
 * endpoints are a third: they accept `service_tier` and may quietly serve the standard tier.
 * That residue is why llm/generative-model.ts still handles the rejection at runtime.

 * Keyed on the endpoint host rather than on the catalog's provider group, because the group
 * is a display bucket while the headers are a property of the server being called: a `custom`
 * entry pointed at OpenRouter is still Adelie talking to OpenRouter and is attributed
 * identically. The flip side is that an entry carrying no `base_url` of its own gets no
 * headers even when `OPENAI_BASE_URL` sends it to a gateway — that variable is read inside
 * AgentHub and never reaches this side.
 *
 * - OpenRouter (https://openrouter.ai/docs/app-attribution): `HTTP-Referer` is the identity
 *   that creates the app page and drives the rankings, `X-OpenRouter-Title` is its display
 *   name, `X-OpenRouter-Categories` files it under marketplace categories.
 * - TokenDance (https://tokendance.space/docs/app-attribution): `X-App-URL` alone, and it
 *   takes priority over any App URL recorded on the API key — the same key may be in use by
 *   other tools, so the per-request value is the accurate one.
 * - OpenCode (https://opencode.ai): `x-opencode-session` alone, and it names the conversation
 *   rather than the app — the gateway keys its routing and prompt caching on it, so the value
 *   has to hold still across a conversation's requests and differ between conversations. It
 *   is **always** sent: the gateway refuses a request that names none (400 "Request is missing
 *   x-opencode-session"). A Session's requests carry the Session's id; a request with none (a
 *   connectivity test, a vision probe) gets a fresh random id, making it a conversation of its
 *   own — never a shared constant, which would file every such request under one session. A
 *   caller that sends several requests without a Session computes the headers once and
 *   reuses them (GenerativeModel does, per instance), so they share that one id.
