/**
 * The user plugin directory (`<root>/plugins`): the library's second source beside the
 * `@lmliheng/*` packages the build ships (see plugins/index.ts). One directory per
 * plugin, laid out exactly like a plugin package — `plugin.json`, `icon.svg`, `skills/`,
 * `hooks/` — so the loader needs no second format: these are the writers a remote download and
 * a local upload go through, and the remover the management UI's delete calls.
 *
 * Installing is a staged swap, the same shape as a Skill install: the files land in a
 * dot-prefixed staging directory (never a valid plugin name, so the loader's scan skips it),
 * are read back through the library's own reader — a directory that would not load is rejected
 * before it is committed rather than installed and silently skipped afterwards — and only then
 * replace the real directory in one rename. The staging directory is cleared first, so a
 * leftover from an interrupted install is never merged into this one. The window between
 * removing the old directory and the rename is the one case this cannot make atomic; it is
 * bounded by a single rm and leaves the plugin absent rather than half-written.
