/**
 * Preset content for builtin Agents; the plugin library lives in @lmliheng/penguin-plugins
 * (the library files are read live when building the preset).
 *
 * - Every Project comes with a single builtin Agent: `default_agent` (the General Agent, the
 *   default conversational Agent), which has the library's preinstalled plugin set installed at
 *   initialization (plugins marked `preinstall: false` are excluded and stay manual-install).
 *   Dedicated capabilities (creating an Agent, optimizing an Agent, etc.)
 *   are carried by Skills rather than dedicated builtin Agents.
 * - The preset carries no AGENTS.md: the default AGENTS.md is empty, with delegation and task
 *   conventions living in the default template's Suggested Workflows section.
 * - Skill metadata is auto-injected into the system Prompt via the `{{SKILL_METADATA}}`
 *   placeholder; it's not registered in AGENTS.md.
