/**
 * Memory: the Agent's long-term notes across Sessions.
 *
 * Memory keeps what cannot be re-derived from the current Workspace or its code history —
 * user feedback, project decisions, working conventions, entry points into external systems.
 * It is **not** context compaction: compaction preserves one Session's short-term working
 * state, Memory preserves what later Sessions need.
 *
 * There are two scopes, both belonging to one Agent and never shared with another:
 *
 *   - **User scope** (`memory/user/`) — what stays true wherever the Agent works: who the user
 *     is, their standing preferences, reference material not tied to one codebase. Every
 *     Session reads it, including one running in a temporary Workspace, which has no other
 *     place to write.
 *   - **Workspace scope** (`memory/<workspace_key>/`) — facts about one Workspace. Sessions of
 *     the same Agent in the same Workspace share it; different Workspaces keep their topic files
 *     apart. A Session in a temporary Workspace gets no Workspace scope at all.
 *
 * Each scope directory carries its own `MEMORY.md` index; only the indexes enter the model
 * context, topic bodies are read on demand. Memory lives in Agent State, so it travels with
 * export / import / snapshots and is visible to every Project member who can reach the Agent.
 *
 * On-disk layout (`agent_state/memory/`):
 *
 *     memory/
 *     ├── user/                        # User scope (no marker: it stands for no path)
 *     │   ├── MEMORY.md                # this scope's index
 *     │   └── <topic>.md
 *     └── <workspace_memory_key>/
 *         ├── .workspace               # the Workspace path this key stands for
 *         ├── MEMORY.md
 *         └── <topic>.md               # frontmatter + body, semantic topics (not per Task/date)
 *
 * The Harness only decides *where* Memory lives, keeps writes inside that directory, and
 * injects the indexes into the prompt; the model owns the semantics — what is worth keeping,
 * how topics are split, and how the indexes are maintained — using the ordinary file tools.
 * Docs: /docs/configuration § "Memory".
