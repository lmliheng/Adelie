/**
 * Reading a Session's source (`session_meta.source`) back from a Trace or from a forwarded meta.
 *
 * Every meta written since the source became required carries one of the six values. A Trace
 * kept from before may carry none (it was a person's conversation, or a desk or ticket Session
 * of company mode) or the retired `benchmark` (a Test Session `penguin run --source benchmark`
 * started, which `penguin run` now records as `cli`). Old Traces are never rewritten: each
 * reader narrows what it reads through this one function instead. Seeing the Trace alone, it
 * reads a missing source as `user`; the server, which also has the Session's index row, reads
 * one whose row was opened by the organization runtime as `company` instead
 * (`readRecordedSource` in the server's runtime/session-sources.ts).
 *
 * Removal: at the 0.3.0 release preparation the `benchmark` branch goes. The `undefined` branch
 * goes only together with a one-time rewrite of old heads, or stays for good — the user decides
 * then: reading never rewrites a head, so every Session created before the source was required
 * would otherwise become a malformed head, the way one without `provider` is.
