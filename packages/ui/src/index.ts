/**
 * @prismshadow/penguin-ui — the shared UI package: token contract, themes, fonts and the
 * component set. Source-only: a consumer's `workspace:*` dependency is linked to this directory,
 * so Vite, vitest and tsc read `src/` through the `exports` map in package.json, never a build.
 *
 * Every component is exported from here, one line per module, grouped by the wave that moved it
 * in. A barrel costs no bundle bytes in a source-only package: the bundlers tree-shake it by
 * module.
