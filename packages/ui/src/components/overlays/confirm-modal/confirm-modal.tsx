/**
 * Confirmation dialog for destructive or overwriting actions (delete, overwrite-on-update,
 * save-to-file, …), deliberately minimal: **no title bar** — just the tone mark, the message and a
 * small Cancel / Confirm pair, so every confirmation in the app is one compact, identical card.
 * `tone` picks the look — danger for deletions, primary for saves and other overwrites. The
 * message and any details (e.g. a version list) go in children; `title` only names the dialog for
 * assistive tech (never rendered).
 *
 * Both button labels are the caller's copy: what "confirm" means is the action's own verb
 * (Delete, Overwrite, Save), and the app's dictionary owns the Cancel beside it.
 *
 * A dialog may add ONE extra choice (`secondaryLabel` + `onSecondary`) between Cancel and Confirm
 * — for prompts whose recommended path is the confirm button while a plain "do it anyway" escape
 * hatch has to stay one click away (the mid-chat thinking-level switch: compact-then-switch /
 * switch anyway / cancel). It stays the same card: a neutral button in the same row, never a
 * second primary. `confirmDisabled` covers the case where that recommended action is temporarily
 * unavailable — the body then says why, and the other choices stay live.
