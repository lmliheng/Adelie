/**
 * The Shiki engine itself: the core, the lazily loaded grammars, and one call that turns code into
 * dual-theme HTML. The package's code components never import it: `CodeSurface` asks a
 * {@link CodeHighlighter} it is handed (by prop or by `CodeHighlighterProvider`), and the app
 * decides where the engine runs — the Web App runs it on a worker and falls back to this thread.
 * So it is published on its own subpath (`@lmliheng/penguin-ui/highlighter`), which a worker can
 * import without React, and kept out of the root barrel, so no static import of the barrel can put
 * a copy of Shiki in the entry chunk.
 *
 * Assembled from `shiki/core` with the language list in code-languages.ts instead of importing
 * `shiki` (its full bundle): that entry point drags in the oniguruma WASM engine and a registry of
 * all 332 bundled grammars, and both land on the *first* code block a conversation renders — 230 KB
 * gzip of WASM before a single token is colored. The pure-JS regex engine replaces it for free:
 * every pattern in every bundled grammar translates to a JS RegExp, and its token output is
 * byte-identical to oniguruma's. Measured on the Web App: ~308 KB -> ~70 KB gzip for the first
 * block.
 *
 * The trade is coverage — a fence in a language not listed in code-languages.ts renders
 * unhighlighted instead of highlighted, where the full bundle would have known it.
 *
 * Both themes of {@link CODE_THEMES} are baked into one pass: the light colours inline, the dark
 * ones as `--shiki-dark` variables that prose.css switches to under the dark mode, so switching
 * light/dark never re-highlights. Grammars load lazily and are cached per language, so a
 * conversation downloads only the languages it shows, once each.
