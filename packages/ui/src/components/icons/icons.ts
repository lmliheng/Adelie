 *
 * Keys name the drawing, never the use: `robot`, not `agents`; `alarmClock`, not `schedule`. A
 * glyph means different things in different places — the chip is the model library in the nav,
 * the eye is watching a run — and the app's own manifests say which drawing stands for which
 * concept (the nav's entries, the stat chips, the grouping options). So a redraw happens here
 * once and every use follows, and two uses that should look alike cannot end up with two
 * drawings of one thing.
 *
 * Each path is one string because `GlyphIcon` draws a single `<path>`: a figure made of several
 * strokes is several subpaths in the one string. Every glyph is stroked at the family's weight,
 * whatever weight it was first drawn at — the weight belongs to the set, not to the mark.
 *
 * The two marks drawn on their own smaller grids (the form-control caret and the close cross)
 * and the rotating chevron are components, not entries: their geometry depends on the grid they
 * are drawn on (`marks.tsx`, `chevron.tsx`).
