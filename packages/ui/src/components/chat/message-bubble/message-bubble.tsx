/**
 * The transcript's messages that are not the agent's reply (that one is `AssistantText`): what
 * the person sent, and the one-line notices the run leaves between turns.
 *
 * - `MessageRow` is a message the person sent: a column on the right, with its footer under it.
 *   A prompt that starts a Task takes a turn's room; a steer delivered inside a running Task is
 *   tighter, since it starts nothing.
 * - `MessageBubble` is the chrome, in four variants: `user`, the prompt's text in a tinted
 *   bubble; `image`, an image sent with it, in the same bubble with a thin inset; `steering`,
 *   a lighter bordered chip for a steer, marked by the person glyph and a short label, with the
 *   images and files it carried inside it; and `notice`, a quiet mono line — an abort, a failed
 *   request, a reconnect with its controls — in the muted ink or, for a reconnect, the attention
 *   ink.
 * - `MessageMeta` is the footer: the time and a copy button. From `sm` up it is invisible but
 *   takes its room (`opacity-0`, not `hidden`), and surfaces while the pointer is over the row or
 *   focus is inside it — hover alone would leave a keyboard user a copy button that is focusable
 *   but never shown, and `hidden` would shove everything below down each time it appeared. Below
 *   `sm` it is always shown: touch has no hover.
 * - `MessageImage` is an image in a bubble or a chip: it opens large on a click.
 *
 * Wrapping: a message is `wrap-anywhere` — long unbroken strings (attachment paths, long URLs)
 * wrap inside the bubble on a narrow screen instead of overflowing, and unlike `break-words` it
 * also shrinks the min-content width, so a pathological token cannot stretch the bubble itself.
 * Ordinary words still break only when a token cannot fit on a line.
