/**
 * The pinned sidebar's frame: one column, top to bottom — an optional mode switch, the switcher
 * row (the fold button and the Project or organization switcher), one pinned entry, the scroll
 * area, and the account row at the foot. The pieces the scroll area is built from are here too:
 * the page nav — pinned entries that always show, then the ones that fold away under a slim
 * toggle — its entries with their pin toggles and the areas a dragged entry can land in, the
 * list's header with its label and its controls, the controls themselves, and the switcher's and
 * the account's buttons.
 *
 * The page nav and the list scroll together, so the nav rides up as the list is scrolled: the
 * scroll area is the column's only shrinkable block, and a column of fixed chrome taller than a
 * short window would push the document into a second scrollbar. The area is its own containing
 * block (`relative`), so an absolutely placed descendant (a row's visually hidden name) scrolls
 * with it rather than stretching the document, and it clips sideways (`overflow-x-clip`) so a
 * pixel of horizontal overflow never turns into a scrollbar under the list.
 *
 * Everything on the column sits on its muted surface, so a hover and a selection are the column's
 * washes of the ink (`NAV_FILL`). The frame paints no background of its own: the column that holds
 * it does (`AppShell`'s navigation slot, or the phone's drawer).
