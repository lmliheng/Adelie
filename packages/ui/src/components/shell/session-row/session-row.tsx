/**
 * A conversation's row in the sidebar's list, and the hover actions it shares with the other
 * conversation rows.
 *
 * The row is the title — with an agent's avatar before it where the group does not name the
 * agent — the marks of its standing arrangements, its live state and its waiting approvals, and a
 * trailing slot that swaps what it shows: the compact last-active time at rest, and on hover or
 * focus the direct actions and the "more" button that opens the whole set as a menu. The same
 * menu opens at the pointer on a right-click, from the keyboard with Shift+F10, and on touch with
 * a press-and-hold (`useRowContextMenu`, whose handlers the row spreads); a hold's replayed click
 * does not also open the conversation. Both panels go through the dropdown's body portal, so the
 * sidebar's scroller cannot clip them.
 *
 * Every mark after the title names itself, in a hint and in visually hidden text, which is what
 * lets the standing ones recede to the subtle ink: the program that opened it (its source),
 * pinned, relayed to a messaging channel, scheduled to run on its own, and work still running in
 * the background. The live state (a turning hourglass, the compress mark, the unread dot) has one
 * reserved box, kept empty when there is nothing to show, so the title never re-flows as a run
 * starts, finishes and is read.
 *
 * The title is the caller's to draw, with the classes the row hands `renderTitle`: the row
 * decides the ink and the weight, the caller its own truncation — the app's line reveals a
 * clipped tail by scrolling it while the row is hovered or focused, keyed on the row's
 * `data-title-reveal`. The trailing slot's width is fixed per language (`timeSlot`), so the marks
 * that end the title sit at one x from row to row, and the hover actions are anchored to its right
 * edge so every row's icons form one column.
 *
 * With a `selection` the row is a batch picker's row rather than a place to go: its checkbox takes
 * the leading edge, the row's click ticks it, and the hover actions step aside for the duration.
