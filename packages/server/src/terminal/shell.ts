/**
 * Which shell a terminal session runs, and how it is invoked.
 *
 * This is deliberately NOT core's `resolveShell()` (environment/tools/command/shell.ts).
 * That one picks a shell for the *agent* to run commands in: it prefers a POSIX bash on
 * Windows because Skills are written for one, and it passes `-NoProfile` to PowerShell so
 * two machines behave identically. Both choices are wrong for a human at a keyboard, who
 * expects the shell their OS gives them, with their own profile in effect — the prompt,
 * the aliases, the PATH edits. So the two resolvers stay separate on purpose.
 *
 * `ADELIE_SHELL` is honoured first on every platform, so a user who has already told the
 * harness which shell to use is not asked twice.
