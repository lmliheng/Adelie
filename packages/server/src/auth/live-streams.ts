/**
 * The live connections a user's sessions are holding open, so revoking a session can end
 * them.
 *
 * An SSE stream is authorised once, when it connects, and nothing on the request path ever
 * looks at it again — so deleting a user's `auth_sessions` rows leaves every stream they
 * opened still writing, and the window on the other end keeps rendering a conversation it
 * is no longer signed in for. This registry is the missing handle: a stream adds itself for
 * exactly as long as it is open, and whatever drops the rows ends the streams in the same
 * step (AdminService.signOutEverywhere).
 *
 * It is a best-effort index, not the source of truth. The streams themselves re-check their
 * own session on the heartbeat (http/sse.ts), which is what covers a caller that drops rows
 * without telling this registry.
 *
 * Nothing is persisted: a connection belongs to the process holding it, and a restart ends
 * every one of them anyway. A hot push builds a new registry along with the App, so streams
 * opened by the previous generation are no longer listed here — their own heartbeat is what
 * ends them, on the same schedule as any other.
