/**
 * Install identity of a data root (`<root>/install-id`).
 *
 * The problem it exists for: the browser keeps UI state in `localStorage` — the new-chat
 * draft with its Workspace, the sidebar's registered Workspaces, pinned Sessions, seen
 * markers — and `localStorage` has no relationship whatsoever to the data root. In the
 * desktop app it lives in Electron's userData directory, so deleting `ADELIE_HOME` does
 * not touch a byte of it. Both halves of every key are compile-time constants
 * (`ADMIN_USER_ID`, `DEFAULT_PROJECT_ID`), so a wipe-and-restart re-provisions the same
 * user and the same Project, the keys line up again, and the state the user thought they
 * had deleted comes back. This file gives the ROOT a name the browser can compare against,
 * so a root the user replaced is recognisable as a different one.
 *
 * It is an IDENTITY, not a credential. It authorizes nothing, so it gets none of the
 * handling `api-token` gets: ordinary file permissions, no rotation, and it is served to
 * unauthenticated callers (http/routes/install.ts) — the browser has to sweep before it
 * knows whether anyone is signed in, and after a wipe nobody is. A `randomUUID` carries no
 * host name, no user name and no timestamp, so publishing it discloses nothing beyond
 * "this root has existed since some earlier boot".
 *
 * Lifecycle: minted the first time a root is used and never touched again. A restart on
 * the same root reports the same id (nothing is swept); a root that was deleted and
 * re-created has no file, so the next boot mints a new one (the browser sweeps).
