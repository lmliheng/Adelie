 * The built-in browser's settings: for now its homepage, the page a new tab opens when it is

 * every use rather than held in memory: across a hot swap the previous App and the next one
 * share the file for a moment, and neither may answer from a copy the other has replaced. No
 * file means the defaults; a file that cannot be read or parsed is logged and means them too.
