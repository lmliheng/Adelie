/**
 * error_records table repo: one row per error the server catches.
 *
 * Key difference from usage_records: **all attribution columns are nullable** — errors
 * from the login/register endpoints have no Project, and process-level catch-alls
 * (uncaughtException) don't even have a request. These **unattributed errors are visible
 * only to admins** (`ErrorFilter.includeGlobal`, defaults to false): they represent other
 * users' login failures, misdirected Session access, and process crashes (the message may
 * contain internal paths and variable values), so surfacing them in any regular member's
 * statistics center would be a cross-tenant information leak — regular members see only
 * their own Project's errors. Admins still see the category that most needs visibility.
 *
 * **Row cap** (MAX_ROWS): errors often come in storms (an API scan producing a wall of
 * 404s, a tool failing repeatedly in a loop), and an uncapped table would blow up disk
 * usage. So the insert path enforces the cap: check capacity every PRUNE_EVERY inserts
 * (insertion sits on the error-handling path, so we avoid COUNT on every call), and when
 * over the limit, evict the oldest rows in ascending id order. The excess is computed via
 * an **exact COUNT**, not an approximation like `id <= MAX(id) - :max` — after
 * deleteByProject removes rows, id and row count diverge, and the approximation would
 * wrongly delete still-valid data within the cap. The first line of defense is
 * ErrorRecorder's short-window deduplication.
