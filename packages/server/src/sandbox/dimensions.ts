/**
 * Runtime helpers over the sandbox vocabulary.
 *
 * The vocabulary itself is `@lmliheng/penguin-core/plugin` — a backend compiles
 * against those names, so they belong with the rest of the plugin contract rather than
 * inside the harness that routes them. What stays here is the code that READS those
 * shapes: which dimensions a provider covers and which a settings object requires, the two
 * questions service.ts routes on. That is the embedder's business, and keeping it out of
 * the contract is what stops it becoming a runtime dependency of every plugin package.
