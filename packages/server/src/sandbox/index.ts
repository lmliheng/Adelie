/**
 * The sandbox capability: the service that routes each spawn's policy to whatever backend
 * implements it. Reached from hmr/platform.ts, so it rides the platform bundle — a
 * deployment changes it by one hot push.
 *
 * The vocabulary it routes ON is not here. `SandboxPolicy`, `SandboxProvider`,
 * `ConfinedArgv` and the mode/dimension unions belong to the plugin contract in
 * `@lmliheng/penguin-core/plugin`, because a backend is written against those names
 * and nothing else. What this directory holds is the embedder's half: which policy reaches
 * which backend, the settings behind it, and the fail-closed behaviour when nothing covers
 * the request.
 *
 * No backend is part of it. Backends are PLUGIN PACKAGES a deployment configures
 * (../plugin/loader.ts), which is why nothing here imports one and why the harness does
 * not depend on the DSH ecosystem at all:
 *
 *   sandbox service  ←  registered backends  ←  the Projects' plugin lists
 *
 * The backends shipped in this repo:
 *
 *   plugin                            platform   fs-write  network  mask-paths
 *   penguin-plugin-sandbox-bwrap      Linux      yes       yes      yes
 *   penguin-plugin-sandbox-seatbelt   macOS      yes       yes      yes
 *   penguin-plugin-sandbox-wsl        Windows    yes       yes      yes
 *   penguin-plugin-sandbox-dsh        all three  yes       —        —
 *
 * The DSH adaptor is the portable floor covering file effects only (its own chain picks
 * bwrap/Landlock, Seatbelt or the Windows ACL runner per host); the three native
 * backends add the other two dimensions, one per platform, and serve every policy they cover
 * when the adaptor is mounted beside them. On Linux the adaptor is the floor where bubblewrap
 * is refused (Ubuntu 23.10 and later restrict unprivileged user namespaces to AppArmor-profiled
 * programs): it confines files through Landlock, which needs neither. Windows is served by bubblewrap
 * inside a dedicated WSL2 distro, so commands there run in Linux (see sandbox-wsl's README).
 * Where none implements a requested dimension, service.ts fails closed naming what each
 * covers rather than quietly confining less than was asked.
