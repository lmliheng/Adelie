/**
 * The sandbox service: owns the registered backends, routes each spawn's policy to a
 * backend that implements the dimensions it requires, and produces the SpawnConfiner
 * closure the runtime transports into core's command-session seam.
 *
 * Routing is by CAPABILITY, not by registration order alone: a policy requiring only
 * `fs-write` goes to the first backend that covers it (the DSH adaptor, which works on
 * Linux/macOS/Windows alike), while a policy also requiring `network` or `mask-paths`
 * goes to the first backend implementing those (penguin-bwrap). Registration order
 * only breaks ties between backends that both cover the request. A request nothing
 * covers fails closed — never a silent unconfined run, and never a silently dropped
 * dimension.
