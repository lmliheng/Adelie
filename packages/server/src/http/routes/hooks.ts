/**
 * An Agent's installed hook packages:
 *   GET    /api/projects/:p/agents/:a/hooks               # installed packages (any member)
 *   POST   /api/projects/:p/agents/:a/hooks/archive       # install one package from an uploaded zip (any member)
 *   GET    /api/projects/:p/agents/:a/hooks/:name/archive # export one installed package as a zip (any member)
 *   DELETE /api/projects/:p/agents/:a/hooks/:name         # uninstall (any member)
 * Whether a Session runs hooks at all is not decided here: that is the Agent-level
 * `hooks.enabled` switch, written through the config route.
 * Installing from the library goes through the plugin routes (plugins.ts), which write a
 * plugin's hook package to agent_state/hooks/<plugin>/ (hooks.json + scripts). The archive
 * routes are the skills routes' pair: POST writes every zip file under hooks/<name>/ (replace
 * semantics with `overwrite`), GET packs the whole directory back under a single top-level
 * <name>/ so the download round-trips through the POST unchanged. Every mutation here
 * invalidates the Agent's cached runtimes: core reads hook packages when a model context
 * opens, so a conversation that is running would otherwise keep the old set until its next
 * compaction. Rebuilding the runtime re-reads them on the next Task instead — which is what
 * lets a package installed from this page start a goal in the conversation already open.

 * Lying entries are worse: unzipSync allocates the declared size and inflates into it, so a

 * a 5-byte VIEW of that buffer — a check on the returned bytes sees 5 and installs it.
