 * Platform code, all of it: what the shell's window may ask of the shell is policy. The
 * shutdown route is authenticated by the shell's Bearer token, not the cookie session (the
 * shell holds no cookie), so its group is unauthenticated and checks the token itself; it
 * answers 202 first, then triggers the graceful shutdown a beat later so the response is not
 * cut off by the closing listener. The update, tray and privacy-settings routes are called by
 * the page, so their groups sit behind the cookie gate and are further restricted to the
 * shell's own window.
