/**
 * Semantic id proposals for every create dialog that names an object with a semantic id:
 *   POST /api/projects/:p/suggest-id   { name, kind, taken? } → { id, source, reason? }
 *
 * `kind` is `project`, `agent`, `benchmark`, `org` or `channel`. The proposal itself is the
 * shared one (services/semantic-id-suggest.ts): the default model of the Project in the path,
 * then the ASCII slug of the name, then a dated placeholder. What differs by kind is decided
 * here, beside the permission each kind's create route demands:
 *
 * | kind        | who may ask                              | id shape                           | avoided on top of `taken`             |
 * | ----------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
 * | `project`   | a member of `:p`                         | admin: plain; else `<username>-…`  | every Project row and data-root entry |
 * | `agent`     | a member of `:p`                         | snake_case                         | the Project's Agent rows and folders  |
 * | `benchmark` | the owner of `:p`                        | kebab-case                         | the Project's Benchmark folders       |
 * | `org`       | a member of `:p`, company mode on        | `co_…`                             | nothing (the dialog's list)           |
 * | `channel`   | a member of `:p`, company mode on        | `ch_…`                             | nothing (the dialog's list)           |
 *
 * A Project is not inside a Project, but its dialog is opened from one, and that Project's
 * default model is the model the user has configured: the path names it. Anyone signed in
 * may create a Project, so membership of the Project whose model is spent is the only gate.
 * The ids avoided are the names the kind's create route refuses with 409, read as names only —
 * not the list views, which skip a folder with no config that the create route still refuses,
 * and open every Agent and Benchmark to answer. For a Project that is every id on the server.
 * None of them reaches the prompt, only the collision suffix. `org` and `channel` delegate to
 * the organization service, recorded as the organization's.
