 *
 * The import and delete routes write inside the user plugin directory, which is part of the
 * installation rather than of a Project — that is what makes them admin-only (machines.ts is
 * the same call) and what makes them take no projectId. They need no restart and no
 * invalidation of anything: the library is read from disk on every request (core's plugin
 * loader caches nothing), so an imported plugin is in the listing and installable the moment
 * the request returns. A name the build already ships is refused rather than shadowed — the
 * loader would go on serving the built-in — and `overwrite` is what says a same-named *user*
 * plugin may be replaced.
 *
 * Installing a plugin writes each of its skills to agent_state/skills/<name>/ and its hook
 * package to agent_state/hooks/<plugin>/ (hooks.json + scripts); reinstalling overwrites with
 * library content (i.e. an update). Installed skills and hook packages keep their own routes
 * (skills.ts, hooks.ts).
 *
 * Library and registry are two views of one kind of thing — a package of skills and/or
 * hooks. The library is what this build carries; the registry is what the deployment can
 * fetch. Both are deployment-global (no Project check); only installing touches an Agent.
