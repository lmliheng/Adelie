/**
 * The plugins a PROJECT asks for, and which of them this process is actually running:
 *
 *   GET    /                      this Project's list, joined with what the process runs,
 *                                 plus which plugins the build ships (any member)
 *   POST   / { specifier,         add a plugin the build ships to this Project's shared table —
 *            machineId? }         or to that machine's own table — and apply (admin); nothing
 *                                 is fetched from anywhere
 *   PUT    / { plugins }          rewrite this Project's shared table, and apply (admin)
 *   DELETE /?specifier=…          drop it from every table of this Project — or, with
 *          [&machineId=…]         `machineId`, from that machine's own table — and apply (admin)
 *
 * WHERE THE LIST LIVES. In the Project's own config (the `[plugins]` table of `.project_config.toml`,
 * package name → requirement, Cargo's `[dependencies]` shape, plus a `[plugins.<machineId>]`
 * table for what one machine runs besides — PluginTables in core),
 * beside its models — because machines are lent to Projects, so a Project's list is what
 * says which machines a plugin has to reach (PRFC-0010). The data root's old `plugins.json`
 * is not read any more, deliberately without a migration: a deployment that had one starts
 * with no plugins until each Project asks again.
 *
 * WHAT ACTUALLY RUNS is the CLOSURE — the union over this root's Projects — because loading
 * is per process: there is one module tree. So a plugin any Project asks for is in the tree,
 * and what it contributes is visible to all of them. A row here is therefore "this Project
 * asked for it" joined with "the process has it", which are two different facts.
 *
 * APPLYING. A write asks the App to re-assemble itself (the platform's own `Reassembly`,
 * hmr/platform.ts): the new create() reads the closure and imports what it names — no
 * process restart, ptys and connections delivered across it exactly as a push delivers
 * them. What a push does not deliver, this does not either: agent runs in flight are
 * stopped and pending approvals denied, in EVERY Project, because there is one tree. The
 * page says so before an admin applies a change. The edit itself travels with the
 * re-assembly (ReassemblyChange): written in its queue, so two admins' edits of one file
 * never interleave, and undone when the new tree fails to boot — the previous App is
 * restored on the previous list, and the answer is "did not take".
