/**
 * Offline rescue for a forgotten admin password — nobody can reset the admin from the web UI,
 * so this does it from the machine that owns the data root (local filesystem access IS the
 * authorization). The account goes back to unclaimed and the next start prints a first-login
 * link, so no plaintext is produced for anyone to write down. Refuses while a server is live,
 * web.db being single-writer. Exported as `@lmliheng/penguin-server/reset-admin-password`
 * so the CLI need not import the package entry, which starts listening.
