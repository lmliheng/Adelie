/**
 * Error persistence: errors caught on the server are all
 * written to error_records through here, for display on the stats dashboard. Shape
 * mirrors usage-recorder — persist only raw facts, leave aggregation to query time.
 *
 * **The classification (kind) criterion is "does a human need to step in"**, not where
 * the error originated:
 *
 * - `expected`: anticipated by the system, has a defined handling path, part of normal
 *   operation, no human needed — HTTP business errors (`HttpError`, mostly 4xx); LLM
 *   `timeout` / `malformed`, and an LLM `failed` the engine went on to retry (the engine
 *   reconnects on all three, so a request the ladder carried cost the user nothing); tool
 *   execution `failed` / `timeout` (the error is fed back to the model, and the Agent
 *   adjusts on its own).
 * - `unexpected`: shouldn't happen, usually a bug or a config/environment fault,
 *   **needs a human** — internal errors converged to 500; process crashes; runtime
 *   errors escaping from background tasks (Session drive / usage persistence / title
 *   generation / subagent registration); LLM `auth` (the credential was rejected and only
 *   a human can replace it) and an LLM `failed` the retries did not recover (the run ended
 *   on it and the user lost the turn).
 * - User-initiated actions **are not errors** and are never recorded: request/tool
 *   `aborted` (user clicked "stop", or denied a tool).
 *
 * Determination: HTTP sources are inferred automatically from `HttpError` (preserving
 * existing behavior); other sources must pass `kind` explicitly at the capture site.
 * The frontend highlights unexpected by default; expected is still recorded without
 * losing information.
 *
 * Sources cover HTTP, Session drive, LLM requests, Environment (tool execution), usage
 * persistence, title generation, subagent registration, and process-level fallback;
 * among these, `llm` / `environment` errors are not expressed via throw (core converges
 * them into the message stream instead), and are fished out by stream-error-watcher from
 * the Session output stream.
 *
 * **This recorder never throws**: it's hooked onto app.onError, and throwing from
 * within it would turn error handling into infinite recursion; if persistence itself
 * fails (disk full / DB already closed, etc.), it's fine to drop that one record.
 *
 * **Short-window dedup (DEDUP_WINDOW_MS)**: error storms are the norm — someone scanning
 * the API produces a wall of 404s, or a tool fails repeatedly in a loop. Persisting each
 * one both write-amplifies and floods the table, and makes the dashboard's "most recent
 * 20" all the same error. So the same `(source, code, Project)` is persisted at most
 * once per window; repeats within the window are **dropped outright** (not persisted);
 * only an actual persist refreshes the timestamp, so a sustained storm leaves a steady
 * one record per window instead of being suppressed indefinitely.
 * **Tradeoff**: aggregate counts therefore **underestimate** — a storm of the same error
 * only counts once, check the logs for true frequency; in exchange, a single error storm
 * doesn't drown out error_records or the stats dashboard. The second line of defense is
 * ErrorsRepo's capacity cap. The dedup table (lastSeen) must stay bounded: past
 * DEDUP_KEYS_MAX, expired entries are cleared first, and if still over the limit the
 * whole table is cleared — better to miss some dedup than let it grow unbounded across
 * different error codes.
