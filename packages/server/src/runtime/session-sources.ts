 * column).
 *
 * Populated wherever the server actually has the meta in hand: Session creation
 * (SessionService reads the just-created core Session's meta), subagent registration
 * (SessionManager reads the forwarded child meta), forks (always `user`), and Trace adoption /
 * lazy list resolution (the trace index's head read). A value read back from a Trace is
 * narrowed through core's `normalizeSessionSource` (the retired `benchmark` reads as `cli`),
 * except that a head recording no source is kept as `null`: what it reads as depends on the
 * Session's index row (`readRecordedSource`), which a head read does not have. An absent entry
 * means "unknown": the list path resolves it from the Trace once per process lifetime.
