 * Populated wherever the server actually has the meta in hand: Session creation
 * (SessionService reads the just-created core Session's meta), subagent registration
 * (SessionManager reads the forwarded child meta), and Trace adoption / lazy list
 * resolution (SessionService reads the Trace head's session_meta). `null` records a
 * **known** user-created Session (meta seen, no source) so the Trace is not re-read on
 * every list; an absent entry means "unknown" and the list path resolves it from the
 * Trace once per process lifetime.
