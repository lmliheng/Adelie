/**
 * The goal plugin's stop hook answers, read off the message stream: every answer is a `hook`
 * event named `goal` whose `output` carries the goal file's state (status, round, tokens_used,
 * budget). The manager maps them to goal_round / goal_finished server events; the CLI reads
 * those server events rather than the hook events, so this is the only place the plugin's
 * record shape is interpreted. Round boundaries are core's: an `isHookInput` that an
 * `isHookContinue` event announced.
