/**
 * The **policy layer** for automatic Session title generation (conversation-page
 * extension).
 *
 * "How to generate" lives in the core SDK (`session.generateTitle`: an out-of-band
 * one-shot request on the session's own Model, no tools, thinking disabled, writes no
 * history/Trace); this module is only responsible for host-side policy:
 *   - When: at Task start, from the **user input alone** — the moment a run begins with
 *     user text, the first words of that text are persisted as an immediate fallback
 *     title, and the LLM request fires in the background to replace it. Neither step
 *     waits for any model output.
 *   - Persistence and notification: writes sessions.title and pushes a `session_title`
 *     server event to the Session channel (once for the fallback, once more if the LLM
 *     result replaces it).
 *   - Manual renames win: the LLM result only ever replaces the fallback this generator
 *     wrote itself (tracked in memory per session); any other value is left alone.
 *   - Bookkeeping: the one-shot request's token consumption is converted to token_usage
 *     and handed to usage-recorder for persistence;
 *   - Silent failure (logged): the fallback stays in place, and while the stored title
 *     still equals it the next Task start retries the LLM request.
