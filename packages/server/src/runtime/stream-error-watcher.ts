/**
 * Error capture within the message stream: LLM request
 * failures and tool execution failures are **both never expressed via throw** — core
 * converges them into the message stream (LLM and Environment handle errors
 * internally and never throw), so a try/catch can't catch a single one. This watcher
 * hooks onto SessionManager's drive, inspects messages one by one, and fishes them out
 * into error_records (source = `llm` / `environment` / `compaction`), matching
 * usage-recorder's shape:
 * recognizes only a few payload types, no-op on the rest. **One instance per run/compact**
 * (its state wraps up accordingly, see close).
 *
 * LLM (source = `llm`): reads the status of `request_end` —
 * - `fatal` → unexpected (`llm_fatal`): a definitive rejection (provider 4xx, credentials,
 *   fast mode on a model without a fast tier) the engine never retries; the run stopped on
 *   it and only a human changing config or credentials can fix it.
 * - `retryable` → depends on whether the retry ladder carried it:
 *     - another attempt followed (a `request_begin` resolved the pending record) → expected
 *       (`llm_retried`): recorded for the record, not raised at an operator;
 *     - nothing followed but the end of the run (an `abort`, or close) → unexpected
 *       (`llm_failed`): the retries did not recover it, the user lost the turn, needs a human.
 * - `aborted` / `completed` are not recorded (the former is a user-initiated interrupt,
 *   not an error).
 *
 * The message uses the real reason: `request_end` carries the error detail on
 * non-completed statuses (`error_message`, from LLMOutcome), and the `abort` event's reason is
 * core's failure-reason prose (e.g. `llm request error: 401 …` / `llm request failed
 * after N retries: …`). A `request_end` failure is first held pending (status + its
 * own detail), not persisted immediately, and is resolved at the next request boundary:
 * - Immediately followed by `abort` → use its reason as the message (the real reason);
 * - Immediately followed by `request_begin` (the engine is retrying — no abort will ever
 *   arrive) → use the staged request_end's own `error_message` detail (e.g. a quota
 *   code), falling back to the generic status text when it carried none. This boundary is
 *   also what tells a survived `failed` from an exhausted one (see the classification above);
 * - Still unresolved when the run ends → close persists it the same way.
 * Exception: when reason is a user-interrupt message (`aborted …`), it's not trusted —
 * "the user clicked stop during backoff" isn't the reason for this timeout, so the
 * status text is used instead (that timeout is a genuine failure and is still recorded).
 * Pending state is bucketed by origin: subagent messages interleave with the parent
 * session's (even more so with parallel subagents), and mixing them up would misattribute.
 *
 * Environment (source = `environment`): reads `tool_call_output`'s stop_reason —
 * `fatal` (and the legacy failed/timeout spellings) → expected (the error is fed back to
 * the model, and the Agent adjusts on its own; `aborted` is denial/interruption, not
 * recorded). Exactly one shape is
 * dropped: a command tool's ordinary non-zero exit, which is how a shell command reports
 * information rather than a fault — see isOrdinaryCommandExit; the same tools' environment
 * faults (killed by a signal, spawn failure, tool timeout) still record.
 * `tool_call_output` only has tool_call_id, no tool name, so `tool_call_id → tool name`
 * is cached (tool_call always arrives before its output), and the tool name is written
 * into code (`tool_failed:exec_command`) — so the stats dashboard's "most common error
 * code" and the error table can show at a glance which tool failed.
 *
 * **Attribution (ctx) is recorded against the session that actually produced the error,
 * not always the parent Session**: a subagent's LLM failures and tool failures also flow
 * through this same stream (carrying origin); if we simply reused the parent ctx passed
 * in at construction, filtering errors by Agent would always show 0 for the child Agent
 * and an inflated count for the parent — both attribution stats and the troubleshooting
 * target would be wrong. So we recognize `session_meta` carrying origin (a subagent's
 * first message, always arriving before any of its failures), registering
 * `origin → {agentId, sessionId}` (agentId derived from the agent_state path, matching
 * SessionManager.registerChildSession's convention); at persist time we look up the
 * message's origin: a hit records the subagent, a miss (a main-session message, or
 * session_meta hasn't arrived yet) falls back to the parent ctx. projectId is always
 * taken from the parent — a subagent is necessarily in the same Project.
