 * Rewrites a message's text into what the user actually wrote.
 *
 * Feishu never puts a mention in the text: it writes a placeholder (`@_user_1`) and carries
 * who it refers to in a parallel `mentions` array. Handed to the model raw, that is a token
 * nothing in the conversation can resolve — a group message reads as `@_user_1 你好` and the
 * model spends its turn asking who `_user_1` is. Every placeholder therefore becomes the
 * mentioned party's name.
 *
 * A LEADING mention of this bot is dropped instead of named, when its open id is known: the
 * bridge feeds inbound text to the model exactly as if it had been typed into the web
 * composer, and a `@Adelie` in front of the sentence would announce the channel the
 * message came through. Only that addressing prefix goes — this bot named further in ("why
 * did @Adelie stop replying?") is a word the user chose, and it reads as itself like
 * anyone else's. An unknown id (see FeishuApiClient.botOpenId) only means the prefix is named
 * too — the confusion the placeholder caused is gone either way.
 *
 * Each key is substituted at its FIRST occurrence only: Feishu emits one placeholder per key,
 * so anything further along that spells the same key is a token the user typed by hand, and
 * it stays as typed.
 *
 * Returns `""` when the message carries nothing but mentions — someone `@`-ed the bot and
 * typed no words — because there is no message there to run a Task on. The emptiness is
 * judged with EVERY placeholder removed, not just this bot's, so it holds whether or not
 * the bot's own id was resolved.
