/**
 * WeChat scan-to-connect: binding the official claw bot by scanning a QR code in WeChat.
 *
 * Unlike QQ, this is not the convenient alternative to typing credentials — it is the ONLY
 * way to obtain them. The bot token this flow issues exists nowhere a person can copy it
 * from: there is no developer console for this channel and no pair of fields to fall back
 * to, so the editor offers a scan and nothing else.
 *
 * The protocol is two calls against `ilinkai.weixin.qq.com`:
 *
 *   1. `get_bot_qrcode` returns a `qrcode` handle and a URL. The URL is ENCODED INTO A QR
 *      CODE and never fetched by this server — WeChat resolves it when the code is scanned.
 *   2. `get_qrcode_status` is LONG-POLLED with the handle until it reports the scan
 *      confirmed, at which point it returns the bot token, the bot id, the id of the person
 *      who scanned, and the API host this bot is to be polled against.
 *
 * ## The `qrcode` handle is the whole security model
 *
 * There is no encrypted payload here as there is on QQ, and so no key to protect: the
 * handle IS the thing that turns into a bot token, and anyone holding it can poll the token
 * out. It is therefore generated here, held here, used here, and dropped here — the browser
 * is given a task id this module mints instead, plus the URL and a status. The QR's URL is
 * safe to render because scanning it authorizes nothing on its own; only the paired handle
 * can collect the result.
 *
 * ## Why the poll is shaped differently from QQ's
 *
 * `get_qrcode_status` is a LONG poll: the platform holds it open until the state changes.
 * That gives the browser its state changes within a second of them happening, but it also
 * means one upstream call outlives several of the browser's polling intervals. QQ answers an
 * overlapping poll with a 404 because there a second poll could bind a second time; here it
 * answers `pending`, because the overlap is the normal case rather than a replay. The
 * once-only guarantee is unchanged and comes from the same place it does on QQ: a resolved
 * task is deleted, so nothing can resolve it twice.
