/**
 * QQ scan-to-connect: binding a bot by scanning a QR code in the QQ app instead of copying
 * an App ID and an App Secret out of the developer console by hand.
 *
 * The protocol is three calls against `q.qq.com`, and it is not part of the bot OpenAPI —
 * different host, different envelope (`{retcode, msg, data}` rather than
 * `{err_code, message}`), no access token. That is why it lives beside qq-api.ts rather
 * than inside it.
 *
 *   1. `create_bind_task` is handed a fresh 32-byte AES key and returns a `task_id`.
 *   2. The `task_id` goes into a URL which is ENCODED INTO A QR CODE and never fetched.
 *      Scanning it in QQ opens the authorization page for the bots the account owns.
 *   3. `poll_bind_result` is polled every couple of seconds until it reports the scan
 *      completed, at which point it returns the bot's App ID and its App Secret encrypted
 *      under the key from step 1.
 *
 * ## The key is the whole security model
 *
 * The AES key decrypts an App Secret, so it is exactly as sensitive as the secret itself.
 * It is generated here, held here, used here, and dropped here — it is never returned by
 * any route, never rendered, and never reaches a browser. What the browser learns is the
 * QR URL, a status, and (once bound) the App ID, which is not secret. This is the same
 * never-round-trip-the-secret rule the PUT handlers follow, applied to a flow where the
 * secret arrives from outside rather than from the user.
 *
 * Tencent publishes an npm package that implements this (`@tencent-connect/qqbot-connector`).
 * It is deliberately not used: it is `UNLICENSED` with no license text, its dist is
 * machine-obfuscated, and it depends on a terminal QR renderer — three separate reasons a
 * product that distributes its server and maintains THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md cannot take it.
 * The protocol is fifty lines and is reimplemented here, behind an injectable seam, in the
 * style of telegram-api.ts.
