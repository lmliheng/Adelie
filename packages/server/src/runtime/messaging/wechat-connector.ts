/**
 * WeChat messaging connector — the fourth implementation of the MessagingChannelConnector
 * seam, over the official claw bot channel. It owns everything WeChat-specific: the config
 * document a scan produces, the transport behind it (injectable for tests — see
 * wechat-api.ts), the long-poll loop that stands in for an event stream, and the context
 * token that threads an outbound send back onto the conversation it answers.
 *
 * ## Inbound is a poll, and there is no webhook anywhere
 *
 * The platform holds `getupdates` open until a message arrives, and the client passes back
 * the opaque cursor it was last given. Nothing in the flow wants a publicly reachable URL —
 * the property that made Telegram's `getUpdates` and QQ's gateway usable here, and QQ's
 * webhook mode not. The loop's lifecycle mirrors telegram-connector's: failures back off and
 * report once per outage, and a recovery fires `onReady` again so the bridge's status tracks
 * the outage.
 *
 * A window that closes with nothing to report is the ORDINARY case on a long poll, not a
 * failure — the transport resolves it as an empty answer on an unchanged cursor, and a loop
 * that treated it as an outage would flap the connection into `error` every quiet minute.
 *
 * ## Readiness is proven by the credential probe, never by a poll
 *
 * A poll is not an event that arrives: it is a request held open until one does. So a
 * connection reported ready only when a poll came back would sit at `connecting` for the
 * whole window on an idle bot — usable the entire time, and saying so nowhere, which is
 * exactly the "works but reports nothing" failure the binding panel exists to kill.
 *
 * Each cycle therefore opens with `checkCredentials`, which answers at once and proves what
 * `connected` means here: the host resolves, the transport works, and the stored token
 * authenticates. Telegram takes the opposite choice for a reason that does not apply here —
 * its one-poller-per-token conflict is visible only on `getUpdates`, so `getMe` cannot prove
 * its connection. This platform has no such rule, and a second connection on one bot is
 * already refused a binding away (409 `account_enabled_elsewhere`).
 *
 * ## The first poll is a DRAIN, and asks for a short deadline
 *
 * An empty cursor means "start from the beginning", so the first poll of a connection can
 * return everything sent while nothing was connected. Its messages are dropped and only its
 * cursor is kept — the same choice telegram-connector makes with `offset: -1`, for the same
 * reason: a binding switched on after a week dark must not replay that week as a task flood.
 * A blip is not affected, because a reconnect keeps the cursor it already had.
 *
 * The short deadline is what keeps that from eating a live message. A drain parked for the
 * long-poll window returns not the backlog but the first thing a user sends AFTER enabling —
 * and then discards it as backlog. Asking only for what the platform is already holding makes
 * "before this connection" and "after it" the two different things they are meant to be.
 *
 * ## Direct chats only, because that is the whole channel
 *
 * This channel carries one-to-one conversations with the bot. A `group_id` exists in the
 * protocol's message shape and the platform never populates it for a bot of this kind, so
 * every inbound message is `direct` and `replyText` has nothing to thread onto — there is no
 * quote relation to honour, so it resolves to the same send `sendText` does. The bridge's
 * threading choice is invisible here rather than wrong.
 *
 * ## Media
 *
 * Text, images and files travel in BOTH directions, and nothing outbound is refused — the
 * widest of the four channels here, where QQ refuses outbound media outright and the other
 * two carry it at a permission's mercy.
 *
 * Two inbound kinds are folded rather than carried as themselves. A VOICE message is relayed
 * as the platform's OWN transcription of it: there is no audio on this seam and nothing
 * downstream would transcribe a recording, while WeChat has already done it — so the usual
 * spoken message is answered rather than refused. A VIDEO arrives as a file. A recording the
 * platform could not transcribe reaches the bridge carrying nothing at all, which is answered
 * with its channel-neutral not-supported notice, the same way QQ's non-text messages are:
 * inventing a channel-specific refusal for it would say no more than the shared one already
 * does.
 *
 * ## The context token
 *
 * Every inbound message carries one, and echoing it on a send is what puts the reply in the
 * right conversation. It is held per (bot, user) in memory only: it is derived from traffic,
 * and the platform accepts a send without one, so persisting it would add a place for a
 * conversation handle to sit at rest in exchange for nothing a fresh inbound message does
 * not fix. A send before this connection has seen any message from that user goes without —
 * which is exactly what "send test message" does after a restart.
