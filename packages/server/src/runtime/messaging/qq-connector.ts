/**
 * QQ messaging connector — the third implementation of the MessagingChannelConnector seam,
 * and the first one whose platform will not let a bot speak freely. It owns everything
 * QQ-specific: the config document's shape (App ID + App Secret), the transport behind it
 * (injectable for tests — see qq-api.ts), the reduction of the two subscribed gateway
 * events to the bridge's normalized inbound shape, and — the part with no counterpart on
 * the other two channels — the PASSIVE REPLY BUDGET.
 *
 * ## Why this file has a budget in it
 *
 * QQ has two ways to send a message and this product can only use one of them. A PASSIVE
 * REPLY carries the `msg_id` of an inbound message, and the platform allows a small,
 * fixed number of them per inbound message inside a short window (see
 * QQ_REPLY_BUDGET / QQ_PASSIVE_WINDOW_MS). An ACTIVE message carries no `msg_id`, is rate
 * limited per bot and per relationship, is capped at a thousand a day, and fails outright
 * for any user who has turned bot pushes off in their QQ client — a switch this product
 * cannot see, ask about, or work around. So every send here is a passive reply, and the
 * budget is not an optimization: past it the platform answers 40034128 and the message is
 * simply gone.
 *
 * The bridge's outbound model does not fit that shape on its own. It relays EVERY
 * completed assistant message of a run as its own chat message, and one run routinely
 * completes more of them than QQ will accept. So this connector reconciles the two:
 *
 *   - The first `budget - 1` messages of an inbound message's answer go out immediately,
 *     one per completed assistant message, exactly as on Feishu and Telegram. The chat
 *     follows the run as it happens for as long as the budget can afford to.
 *   - Everything after that accumulates in a tail buffer, which is sent as ONE combined
 *     message using the reserved final slot. Dropping the end of a reply is the worst
 *     failure available here, so nothing is ever dropped — it is combined.
 *   - The tail is flushed after a short quiet period (QQ_TAIL_FLUSH_MS). This connector
 *     cannot see run boundaries — the seam deliberately does not show it any — and quiet
 *     is the honest local proxy for "the answer is finished". The delay applies only to
 *     runs that overflowed the budget in the first place.
 *   - The approval notice competes for the same budget, and it must not lose: a run
 *     blocked on approval will not produce another message until a human acts, so a notice
 *     that waited for the run to finish would wait forever. It is therefore an ordinary
 *     send — it takes an immediate slot when one is free, and otherwise joins the tail,
 *     whose quiet timer fires a second later precisely because the run has gone quiet
 *     waiting for the approval. Either way it arrives.
 *   - Once the final slot is spent, further messages keep accumulating and are flushed by
 *     the next inbound message, whose `msg_id` carries a fresh budget — that is the only new
 *     budget that ever exists — provided the message they were written for has not itself
 *     expired in the meantime (see noteInbound).
 *   - A chat's accounting lives no longer than the connection that opened it. Closing the
 *     gateway — the unbind, or the restart a credential change makes — forgets that
 *     account's ledgers, so nothing withheld can arrive in a chat the binding has stopped
 *     answering; and a chat left quiet past the window is swept when the map next grows.
 *
 * ## Why an undeliverable reply throws instead of vanishing
 *
 * With no fundable slot — no inbound message yet, the window closed, or the budget spent
 * with the tail already flushed — a send THROWS rather than silently returning. QQ offers
 * no push this product may use, so the honest report is that the reply did not arrive, and
 * the bridge turns that into one error record (the error recorder collapses a storm of the
 * same code into one row per window, so a conversation driven from the web UI does not
 * flood it). Silence would be worse in both directions: the "send test message" button
 * would claim a delivery that never happened, and a user watching QQ for an answer would
 * have nothing to explain its absence.
 *
 * ## Why `replyText` and `sendText` do the same thing here
 *
 * On Feishu and Telegram a reply-to is a visible relation — the chat renders a quote header
 * — which is why the bridge threads a run's first message onto the inbound one and sends
 * the rest plainly. On QQ `msg_id` is an authorization anchor, not a quote: a passive reply
 * renders exactly like any other message. So both seam methods resolve to the same
 * operation, and the bridge's threading choice is invisible here rather than wrong.
 *
 * ## Media
 *
 * Text only, in both directions. Inbound images are not normalized (a non-text message
 * reads as no text, which the bridge answers with its notice) and outbound files are
 * refused with a reason — see refuseMedia, which explains what QQ would require.

 * which takes a PUBLICLY REACHABLE https URL — the same requirement that ruled the webhook
 * mode out and made this a gateway connection in the first place — and only then can a
 * `msg_type: 7` message reference the handle it returns. Documents are worse still: the
 * platform lists a file type and does not open it. And any such message would spend a slot
 * from the same passive-reply budget the text is already rationing.
 *
 * So the honest answer is a refusal that names the reason. The bridge files the refusals of one
 * reply as one error record naming every file, and the reply's text still arrives — quietly
 * resolving would tell it a picture reached a chat that never received one. It is a
 * `MessagingUnsupportedError` rather than a bare one so that record is filed as expected: this
 * refusal is the platform's shape, identical every time, and nothing an operator reads a
 * dashboard to find (see error-kind.ts).
 *
 * The text names no file, and that is deliberate: the record's head names every file it covers,
 * and a refusal that reads the same for each is what lets them share the one reason line (see
 * the bridge's messagingFilesNotSentRecords) instead of repeating it once per file.
 *
 * The passive-reply-window refusal in `enqueue` deliberately stays a BARE `Error`, and the
 * split is the point rather than an oversight: this one costs nothing, since the reply text
 * still reaches the chat and the record names the file that did not follow it, while that one
 * IS the reply — the text is dropped and the chat cannot be told, because the message that
 * would carry the reason is the message being refused. Somebody therefore does have to notice
 * it, which is what `unexpected` is for; and `MessagingUnsupportedError` promises the opposite
 * in its own contract (a refusal the platform repeats identically, with no fault to chase and
 * no fix to deploy), which a reply lost to an expired window does not keep.
