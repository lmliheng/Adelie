/**
 * The WeChat half of the WeChat connector: the wire protocol of the official claw bot
 * channel, behind an injectable seam so tests substitute a fake and never open a socket
 * (the shape qq-api.ts and telegram-api.ts share).
 *
 * ## What this protocol is, and why it is reimplemented here
 *
 * Tencent publishes the channel as an OpenClaw plugin
 * (https://github.com/Tencent/openclaw-weixin, MIT) and there is an independent SDK derived
 * from it (https://github.com/wong2/weixin-agent-sdk, MIT, npm `weixin-agent-sdk`). Both are
 * readable, and both describe the SAME protocol: plain JSON over HTTPS, no proprietary
 * binary, no obfuscated dist. Neither is taken as a dependency, and the reason is shape
 * rather than licence: both own the process's message loop (`login()` then `start(agent)`),
 * carry ONE account, render the login QR to a TTY with `qrcode-terminal`, and persist their
 * state under `~/.openclaw`. This product needs many bindings side by side, each with its
 * own stored config document, and a QR that reaches a browser. So the protocol is
 * reimplemented against the same endpoints, the way qq-scan.ts reimplements Tencent's
 * bind-task protocol rather than taking its npm package.
 *
 * ## Inbound is a long poll, which is why this channel is possible at all
 *
 * `getupdates` is held open by the server until a message arrives or the window closes, and
 * the client passes back the opaque `get_updates_buf` cursor it was last given. There is no
 * webhook and no public URL anywhere in the flow — the same property that made QQ's gateway
 * usable and QQ's webhook mode not.
 *
 * ## Media rides a CDN, encrypted, and the encryption is not optional
 *
 * A picture or a file is never inline. Outbound: `getuploadurl` issues a pre-signed URL for
 * bytes the caller has already AES-128-ECB encrypted under a key it generates, and the CDN
 * answers with the `x-encrypted-param` handle that the message item then references.
 * Inbound: the item carries a URL and the key, and the bytes are ciphertext until decrypted.
 * ECB with a per-file random key is the platform's choice, not one made here — the framing
 * is what it is, and the alternative to implementing it is not carrying media at all.
 *
 * ## `context_token`
 *
 * Every inbound message carries one, and it is echoed on every outbound send to the same
 * user. It is a routing hint rather than an authorization anchor — the platform accepts a
 * send without one, which is what a first send after a restart does — so it is threaded
 * through where it is known and omitted where it is not, and never persisted: it is derived
 * from traffic, and traffic is what re-derives it.
