/**
 * Per-file record offsets for Trace JSONL, so a page of events costs one ranged read
 * instead of a parse of the whole file.
 *
 * The events endpoint used to read and parse the whole shard for every page it served: a
 * 25 MB shard walked in pages of 1000 was parsed fourteen times per panel open. Here each
 * file version is scanned once (the scan does parse every line, to decide which ones are
 * records), and every later page reads only the bytes of the records it returns.
 *
 * Ordinals equal `readTraceTolerant`'s, which is what `tracePosition` and the analysis'
 * `messageFrom`/`messageTo` are counted in: a line is a record iff its trimmed text is
 * non-empty and parses as JSON. A malformed middle line is skipped, as `parseTraceLines`
 * skips it. A final segment with no `\n` yet is a record exactly when it parses, as the
 * tolerant reader counts it; such a segment is never taken as scanned, so a crash-torn
 * tail that the writer later heals (with a leading `\n`, see core's `probeTornTail`) is
 * re-read and becomes the skipped middle line it then is.
 *
 * Versions: a file that only grew (same inode, larger size, mtime not earlier) is scanned
 * from where the last scan stopped; anything else (truncation, replacement, an in-place
 * rewrite of the same size) is scanned again from the start. The newest
 * `TRACE_LINE_INDEX_MAX_FILES` files are kept.
