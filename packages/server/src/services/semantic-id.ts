/**
 * A semantic id derived from a display name without a model (pure, unit tested): the ASCII
 * fallback of `suggest-id`, and the sanitizer every model answer passes through before it is
 * offered. Diacritics are folded (`Café` → `cafe`), every run of anything but a letter or digit
 * becomes one separator, and the result is lowercased. What the id then has to look like is
 * the kind's, and one table says it for every kind a create dialog names:
 *
 * | kind        | prefix               | words joined | the id the create route accepts          |
 * | ----------- | -------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
 * | `org`       | `co_`                | `_`          | `^[a-z][a-z0-9_]{1,63}$`                 |
 * | `channel`   | `ch_`                | `_`          | `^[a-z][a-z0-9_]{1,63}$`                 |
 * | `project`   | none (admin)         | `_`          | `^[a-z][a-z0-9_]{1,63}$`                 |
 * | `project`   | `<username>-` (user) | `_`          | `<username>-[a-z0-9_]+`, 64 at most      |
 * | `agent`     | none                 | `_`          | `^[a-z][a-z0-9_]{1,63}$`                 |
 * | `benchmark` | none                 | `-`          | letters, digits, `_` and `-`; 100 at most |
 *
 * The organization's and the channel's prefix says what an id names and makes every core a
 * valid id; a core that already carries it is not prefixed twice. A non-admin's Project id
 * lives in its owner's namespace, so that prefix is the username the route already demands,
 * not a convention. A Benchmark id is kebab-case, like the ones the evaluation Skills write.
 * The prefixes are a generator's convention, not a rule the server enforces: an id typed by
 * hand is accepted as written, and ids that predate them keep working.
 *
 * A core the kind still rejects — an unprefixed id that would start with a digit, or a
 * one-letter one — is tried once more behind the kind's noun (`3D Viewer` → `agent_3d_viewer`),
 * which keeps the words rather than discarding a name that did carry ASCII. A name with no
 * ASCII letters or digits at all (a Chinese name) yields null: nothing mechanical can name it,
 * and that is exactly the case the model exists for. When the model cannot name it either,
 * `placeholderSemanticId` is the floor — a valid, dated, obviously-temporary id, so the dialog
 * is never left with nothing to put in the box.
