/**
 * Signed tokens for Workspace HTML preview on a separate origin.
 *
 * The preview origin deliberately differs from the App origin, so it never receives the
 * session cookie — cookies are keyed by host and ignore port, which is why the two
 * must differ by hostname and not merely by port. Authorization therefore travels in
 * the URL as a short-lived HMAC token instead.
 *
 * The token binds three things: the Session whose Workspace may be read, the host the
 * preview must be served from, and an expiry. Binding the host is what keeps this from
 * becoming a same-origin XSS hole — the same process also answers on the App origin, so
 * without that check `/preview/<token>/index.html` would happily execute Agent-written
 * HTML with the App's cookies. See previewRoutes for the enforcement.
 *
 * The signing secret is generated per process: tokens are short-lived anyway, so losing
 * them across a restart costs nothing and there is no secret to persist or rotate.
