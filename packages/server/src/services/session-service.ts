/**
 * Session index service.

 * Lists are served from the DB index alone — no Trace directory scanning in steady state

 * Sessions that exist only as Trace files (left behind by a pre-server CLI) are adopted
 * into the index once per boot by the startup sweep (`adoptUnmanagedTraceSessions`):
 * the trace index's registration-time facts supply (provider, model_id) / workspace,
 * and the row is stamped `client: "cli"` (approval_mode defaults, createdAt taken from
 * the timestamp embedded in session_id).
 * Create: via core's `agent.createSession` (the model reference is always a complete
 * (provider, modelId) pair — both or neither; omitting both falls back to the
 * Project's default reference, 400 if there is none); the new Session is
 * added to session-manager's active table (state idle).

   * not classified yet (no in-process source entry): it supplies the Trace locations for
   * the one-time head reads and backfills the `has_trace` cache; once every row is
   * classified, list calls touch only the DB.
   *
   * Optional `paging` returns just that slice (the sidebar pages with limit+1 to detect
   * "has more"); slicing happens before toInfo, so per-request source derivation (lazy
   * Trace-head reads) stays bounded by the page size.
   *
   * The `before` form pages the activity order by cursor: only rows strictly below it are
   * walked and served. An offset cannot page that order, because a row below the offset that
   * becomes active moves above it and the next page would skip a row; a cursor stays put — the
   * moved row is simply not served again (the client learns of it from `session_state`). The
   * offset form keeps serving the `created` order exactly as before.
   *
   * `category` filters to one sidebar bucket **before** paging, so offset/limit page
   * within the category. Filtering needs each walked row's category (a possible
   * Trace-head read per row, cached in the sources registry); without `withCounts`
   * the walk stops as soon as the requested page is complete. `withCounts` classifies
   * every row, a cursor or not, and returns per-category totals over the whole list — plus
   * the same totals broken down by Workspace path, and each path's newest Session's
   * `createdAt` — so the sidebar can label the collapsed folders, list every Workspace that holds
   * Sessions (not only the ones its loaded pages happen to touch) and place the groups
   * by recency, all without loading them.
   *
   * `workspaceGroup` filters the same way, to one Workspace group (see workspace-group.ts),
   * so a sidebar grouped by Workspace pages each group down its OWN stream instead of
   * sharing one per-Agent cursor — without it, one group's "load more" consumes the page
   * its siblings were about to read, and their rows move on screen untouched. The two
   * filters compose; the returned counts stay whole-Agent either way.
   *
   * A `company` Session — company mode's desk and ticket Sessions, which only company mode's
   * own views list — belongs to no category (listCategory), archived or not: every classified
   * form of the list (`category`, `workspaceGroup` or `withCounts`) leaves it out of the page,
   * the totals, the Workspace breakdown and its stamps alike. The plain form, which classifies
   * nothing, still serves every row.
   *
   * `excludeOrg` drops the rows an organization owns (its desk and ticket sessions, and the
   * sub-sessions they spawned) from the stream BEFORE anything else looks at it — the page,
   * `counts`, `workspaceCounts`, `workspaceLatest` and the limit+1 "has more" all describe the
   * same own-rows stream. It is what development mode's list asks for: that list draws the
   * user's own conversations, and a total or a stamp that still counted a desk or a ticket
   * session would make its Workspace appear as a group the list can never fill. The `company`
   * rule above does not replace it: the sub-sessions are `subagent` Sessions, a person's
   * conversation attached to a ticket is stamped `org` but stays `user`, and a row the
   * organization caches name before the reconcile pass stamps it reads as `user`. Without the
   * flag every row is served, whichever client created it, but for that rule.
