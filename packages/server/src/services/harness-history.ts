/**
 * The harness history, kept by the platform itself. The runtime commits a version
 * (harness.json) and knows nothing else about it; the platform that boots IS that version
 * and records it here — the runtime's commit record plus the interface table this platform
 * was built from — under `<root>/harness-history/`, its own directory beside the
 * runtime's store. Every boot records (a push, a restart, a fresh install), so the record
 * is complete on any runtime old enough to boot this platform.
 *
 * The record is made once the runtime's commit has LANDED, never before: on a push the
 * runtime commits after the boot succeeds, so at setup harness.json still names the previous
 * version, and a line written then would carry the previous bundles under this platform's
 * table. `hmrControl.current()` resolves when the swap that booted this platform is over —
 * commit included — and that is when the line is written. A generation the runtime put back
 * (its boot failed) never records: what harness.json names then is not it.
