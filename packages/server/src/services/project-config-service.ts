/**
 * `.project_config.toml` read/write (single hidden config file).
 *
 * Doesn't reuse core's loadProjectConfig/saveProjectConfig (they only keep known
 * fields): reads and writes the complete object directly via smol-toml, preserving
 * extension fields like `name`. credential (api_key / base_url / created_at) is
 * **inlined on the model entry** — there's no longer a supplementary section or
 * secrets file; since the file contains secrets, it's always written with mode
 * 0600. Plaintext only ever hits disk, and is always masked in responses.
 *
 * Model references are **fully split into separate fields**: an entry is
 * stored as two independent fields, `provider` and `model_id`; the `(provider,
 * model_id)` pair is the entry's unique key. `model_id` is the upstream request id,
 * sent to AgentHub verbatim — string concatenation like `<provider>/<id>` is
 * forbidden everywhere in the pipeline. `default_model` / `vision_model` are `{
 * provider, model_id }` paired references (TOML tables).
 *
 * Reads are memoized on the file's mtime (see readTable): every consumer of this
 * service — scheduler model-ref validation, the models/schedules routes, usage
 * pricing — shares one parsed table per on-disk version instead of re-reading and
 * re-parsing the TOML per call. The service's own writes all funnel through
 * `writeRaw`, which invalidates synchronously; external edits (CLI, hand edits) are
 * caught by the stat. The cached table is shared between callers and must be treated
 * as immutable — every mutating method here copies before changing.
