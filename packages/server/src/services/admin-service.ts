/**
 * Admin user backend: user list / create / reset password / delete.
 *
 * - Create: username is the user_id (^[a-z][a-z0-9_-]{1,31}$); admin sets the initial
 *   password, flagged with password_is_initial; a default Project `proj-<username>` is
 *   auto-created, rolling back the user row on failure.
 * - Reset password: also flags the password as initial and clears all of the user's
 *   login sessions (forcing re-login).
 * - Delete: the built-in admin cannot be deleted; Projects owned by the user are
 *   deleted along with it (including data directories), with sessions/memberships/UI
 *   preferences cascade-deleted via foreign keys.
 *
 * Both of those end sessions, so both go through `signOutEverywhere`: dropping the rows
 * alone leaves the connections those rows authorised still open.
