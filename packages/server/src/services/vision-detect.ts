/**
 * Vision capability detection for a configured model.
 *
 * The models dialog can leave "supports vision" unset and ask the model itself. Unlike the
 * protocol probes (services/protocol-detect.ts), this cannot be a deliberately invalid
 * request: the only way to learn whether an endpoint accepts image input is to send an
 * image and see what comes back. So this probe **is a real, billed completion** on the
 * user's credential. Everything here exists to make it the cheapest honest one:
 *
 *   - a 1x1 PNG (67 bytes) — the smallest thing that is still a decodable image;
 *   - a prompt asking for one word, with the same anti-thinking hint the connectivity
 *     probe uses, so reasoning models do not burn the budget before answering;
 *   - `maxTokens` in the single digits and no tools, so the completion cannot run long.
 *
 * Verdict, deliberately three-valued — "it didn't work" and "it works and the answer is
 * no" are different facts, and only the first is worth telling the user to go check their
 * credentials over:
 *   - `supported`   the model accepted the image and answered;
 *   - `unsupported` the model answered *about the image being unacceptable* — a modality
 *     rejection is a definitive negative, not an error;
 *   - `failed`      anything else (auth, network, timeout, an unrelated 400): the probe
 *     learned nothing, so the capability stays exactly as the user left it.

 * talk about the content part type, Anthropic about the block type, gateways about the

 * as `failed` merely shows the generic "check your key and URL" message, which is
