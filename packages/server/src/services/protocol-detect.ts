/**
 * Protocol auto-detection for custom model endpoints.
 *
 * Given a base URL (plus an optional API key), probes which of AgentHub 0.4.2's three
 * generic protocol clients the endpoint actually serves, in this fixed order:
 *
 *   1. `openai-responses` — OpenAI Responses API,   POST {base}/responses
 *   2. `ant-messages`     — Anthropic Messages API, POST {base}/v1/messages
 *   3. `openai-chat`      — OpenAI Chat Completions, POST {base}/chat/completions
 *
 * Paths and auth headers mirror exactly what the AgentHub clients construct (verified
 * against the SDKs they wrap): the OpenAI SDK appends `/responses` / `/chat/completions`
 * to the base URL and authenticates with `Authorization: Bearer`; the Anthropic SDK
 * appends `/v1/messages` and AgentHub's AntMessagesClient sends the credential through
 * BOTH `x-api-key` and `Authorization: Bearer` (plus `anthropic-version`), which every
 * covered server/gateway accepts. Probing the same URL the client would call means a
 * detected protocol is one that will actually work after saving.
 *
 * Probe design: each probe POSTs a deliberately minimal invalid body (`{}`) — zero token
 * cost, no valid model id needed, and the error it provokes reveals whether the route is
 * really an API endpoint. Classification:
 *   - 404 / 405 → the route does not exist (`route_missing`). This is judged by status
 *     alone: OpenAI-style servers wrap unknown paths in protocol-shaped 404 JSON, and the
 *     probe body carries no model id, so a 404 can never mean "model not found".
 *   - other 4xx (400 validation, 401/403 auth, 422, 429 …) with a JSON API-error shape →
 *     the route exists and answers like an API (`served`). Auth failures count: probing
 *     without a key still detects the protocol. The error-shape check is deliberately
 *     tolerant (OpenAI `{error:{…}}`, Anthropic `{type:"error",…}`, vLLM/FastAPI
 *     `{detail:…}` / `{object:"error",…}`, bare `{message:…}`) because the probed PATH
 *     is what discriminates protocols — the shape check only weeds out HTML error pages
 *     and gateway junk.
 *   - 2xx → `served` only with protocol-specific success markers (guards against
 *     catch-all gateways that 200 every path).
 *   - 5xx → `server_error`, not served: gateways emit 5xx regardless of path existence,
 *     so it proves nothing; detection moves on to the next protocol.
 *   - non-JSON body → `junk`; fetch failures → `timeout` / `network_error`.
 *
 * Probes run sequentially in the order above and stop at the first `served` hit. The API
 * key is only ever placed in request headers — never in URLs, results, or logs.
 *
 * The typed URL is not taken literally: it is normalized and paired with its neighbouring
 * `/v1` form (see candidateBaseUrls), and every candidate gets the full protocol sequence
 * before the next one is tried. The candidate that answered is reported back as `baseUrl`
 * so the caller can correct the field. Worst case a detection is six short probes.
 *
 * Credential resolution is layered: the caller passes the key typed in the dialog or the
 * entry's stored one, and when there is neither, each probe falls back to the environment
 * variable for the protocol IT speaks (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for `ant-messages`,
 * `OPENAI_API_KEY` for the two OpenAI protocols — see envApiKeyForProtocol) — but only when
 * the probed base URL is that vendor's own endpoint. A gateway or a private server gets an
 * anonymous probe: detection still
 * works with no credential at all (a protocol-shaped 401 identifies the route), and sending
 * the user's vendor key to a URL they typed is exactly what the rule forbids.
