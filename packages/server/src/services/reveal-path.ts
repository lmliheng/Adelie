/**
 * Showing a file in the machine's own file manager — what the Files panel's "Show in folder"
 * asks for, and only ever on the machine this server runs on.
 *
 * Two of the three platforms can point at the file itself: Finder takes `-R`, Explorer takes
 * `/select,`. A Linux desktop has no portable way to ask for a selection, so it gets the
 * containing directory, which is the part of the request that always holds.
 *
 * Nothing here waits for the file manager — it outlives the request that opened it, so the
 * child is detached, given no stdio and unref'd. What IS awaited is the spawn itself: a
 * command that is not on the machine at all (a headless box has no `xdg-open`) has to reach
 * the caller as a failure rather than as a window that never appeared.
