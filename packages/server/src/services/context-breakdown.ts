/**
 * Context composition: what the Session's current model context is made of, split into the six
 * parts a reader can act on — system prompt, tool definitions, user messages, model messages,
 * tool requests, tool results — plus the tools whose call traffic occupies the most of it, and
 * the files the three file tools spent the most of it on.
 *
 * The basis is **one Trace shard**. A shard is one complete model context by construction: the
 * writer rotates on compaction and opens the new file with `session_meta` followed by
 * `tool_list_ready`, and Session resumption keeps appending to the shard it left off in. So a
 * Session's newest shard holds exactly the messages the model still sees. The one exception is
 * a shard whose last record is a completed `compaction_end`: that context is closed and the
 * next one has not been written yet (rotation is deferred until the first write after the
 * compaction), so the composition describes what was compacted away rather than what the model
 * now carries. `contextClosed` reports it; the rule is the same one Trace replay applies to
 * decide it must replay nothing.
 *
 * Sizes come from the character heuristic core already applies to request inputs
 * (`approximateMessagesTokens`: ASCII at ~4 characters per token, wide characters at 1, a flat
 * allowance per image), not from a tokenizer — this project ships none, and occupancy itself is
 * read off the provider's `token_usage`. Every figure here is therefore an estimate; what it is
 * good for is **shares**, which is what its consumers spend it on.
