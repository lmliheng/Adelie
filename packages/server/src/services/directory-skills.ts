/**
 * Skills read from a directory the user picked, rather than from the built-in library.
 *
 * A coding agent writes its Skills into one of two places in a checkout — `.agents/skills/` or
 * `.claude/skills/` — so both are read. `.claude` is very often a symlink to `.agents` (it is in
 * this repository), which would otherwise offer every Skill twice: the two roots are resolved
 * through `realpath` and a shared target is read once. Where both exist as real directories and
 * carry the same Skill name, `.agents` wins — it is the canonical location and `.claude` is the
 * compatibility alias.
 *
 * A directory the user points at is untrusted input in exactly the way an uploaded archive is, so
 * this reuses the archive import's caps (skill-import-limits.ts) and its walk discipline: **every**
 * file is read only after an `lstat`/`Dirent` says it is a regular file within the cap, so a
 * symlink cannot pull in a file outside the Skill directory, a FIFO or device node cannot block
 * the read forever, and an oversized file is refused before it is in memory rather than after.
 * A directory without a parseable `SKILL.md` is not a Skill and is passed over rather than
 * reported — these trees hold plenty that was never meant to be installed — and so is a Skill
 * whose files cannot be read or exceed the caps: one bad Skill must not hide the rest.
 *
 * Discovery is metadata-only. Auxiliary files are the installable payload, so they are read for
 * the names actually picked (`resolveDirectorySkills`) and never for a listing.
