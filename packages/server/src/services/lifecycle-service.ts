/**
 * Process lifecycle as a runtime capability: whether a supervisor relaunches this process
 * when it exits, and the restart trigger the platform's `POST /api/version/restart` pulls
 * once a self-update is installed.
 *
 * The supervisor is `penguin server|web`, which runs the service as a child process and
 * respawns it on SERVER_RESTART_EXIT_CODE (core); it announces itself with
 * ADELIE_SUPERVISED=1. Under anything else — the server entry started directly, a dev
 * run, the desktop shell (which updates the whole app, not the server) — a restart request
 * is refused rather than honored: exiting would stop the service with nobody to bring it
 * back, and the page tells the user to restart by hand instead.
 *
 * Mechanism only: what a restart is *for* is the platform's business (the update flow);
 * this class knows how to leave, and who is there to catch it.
