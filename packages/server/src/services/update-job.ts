/**
 * The self-update job: runs the CLI as `node <entry> update --yes` in the background and
 * exposes its progress, so the Web App's update modal can show a bar and be sent to the
 * background instead of holding one long request open (POST /api/version/update used to
 * answer only when the run was over — up to ten minutes with nothing to show). One job per
 * process: a start while one runs joins it, and the finished status stays readable until
 * the next start (which is also how a failed run is retried).
 *
 * How the self-update works: `penguin server|web` exports its own entry script path as
 * PENGUIN_CLI_ENTRY — the pre-rename spelling of ADELIE_CLI_ENTRY, and the config parser
 * reads both — before importing this server, and the job re-runs that script as
 * `node <entry> update --yes` — the CLI's update command owns all install-kind detection,
 * download and replacement logic (packages/cli/src/commands/update.ts). A server started
 * any other way (tests, a custom embedding) has no CLI to run and reports "unsupported".
 * SECURITY: the spawned argv is a fixed literal list; nothing from any request flows into
 * the command, its arguments, or its environment.
 *
 * Progress is read off the run's combined output, best-effort: the tarball installer
 * prints `Downloading <asset> from <source> ...` right before its `curl --progress-bar`
 * run, whose bar carries the percentage, and `<layer> checksum OK.` once the bundle is
 * verified; everything before the first is the release lookup and the installer fetch. A
 * run that prints none of it (an npm install, say) stays in `resolving` with no
 * percentage — the phase is a hint for the bar, never a fact the outcome depends on.
 *
 * Interpreting the CLI's outcome: `penguin update` exits non-zero only when an upgrade was
 * attempted and failed; refusals (source checkout, unrecognized layout, Windows) print a
 * message and exit 0. Exit codes alone therefore cannot separate "updated" from
 * "unsupported", so the spawn forces ADELIE_LANG=en and classifies by the refusal
 * messages' stable English fragments (packages/cli/src/i18n.ts, `update` section). That
 * matching is reliable here because the spawned CLI and this server ship in lockstep from
 * the same install — the strings can never be from a different release than this code.
 *
 * A platform hot-swap while a run is in flight builds a fresh service that knows nothing of
 * it; the child finishes on its own and only its status is lost. Rare enough to accept.
