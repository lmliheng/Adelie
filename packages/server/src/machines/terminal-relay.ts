/**
 * A terminal on a machine, served through this server's own terminal stream.
 *
 * The runtime serves ONE kind of socket, `/api/terminals/<id>/stream`, and everything it
 * does with it is ask the platform: `terminals().get(id)` for the session, then
 * `attachStream(ws, session, url)` to drive the protocol. It never looks inside either. So a
 * terminal that lives on a machine needs no runtime change at all — the terminal manager
 * answers `get` with a reference to the remote pty (asked of this relay for an id it does
 * not hold itself), and `attachStream` relays the socket to that machine's own stream
 * through the connection this server holds to it (a channel dialled through the session's
 * SOCKS port, like every other request to a machine's API). Platform code, pushed like any
 * other; the runtime is exactly what it was.
 *
 * The reference is spelled in the id: `<terminalId>@<machineId>@<userId>`. The user id is
 * there for the runtime's owner check, which compares the session's `ownerUserId` with the
 * authenticated user — a client can only name itself, and an id naming anyone else is
 * refused before this code runs. What that leaves to check here is that the user may reach
 * machines at all, which is this server's admins (the session minted on the machine is an
 * admin's).
 *
 * The relay carries messages verbatim. The protocol (frames, backpressure, restore) is the
 * machine's; both ends speak it and this server does not need to.
