/**
 * The one connection per machine, against a stub `ssh` on PATH that becomes a real `sh` when
 * asked for one (POSIX only).
 *
 * - Commands run with their exit code, and an `exit` cannot end the session.
 * - A command gets its stdin as a heredoc, bytes intact, and its lines are relayed as they
 *   arrive.
 * - There is one session however many ask: commands to one machine queue, two opens spawn
 *   once, and different machines run side by side.
 * - A session that dies says why in ssh's own words and is not kept.
 * - A command that outlasts its timeout answers with the timeout, and the next one gets a
 *   live session; on a held session the corpse is dropped but the hold kept.
 * - A held session that dies comes back on its own after the shortest reconnect wait; a
 *   closed one stays closed; closing lets go, and the next ask opens a new session.
