/**
 * The first-login link: the claim route's proof for a server nobody has signed in to yet
 * (auth/service.ts, routes/auth.ts). The desktop shell's token, the route's other proof, is
 * covered in desktop.test.ts.
 *
 * The link CARRIES a session rather than a secret redeemed for one. That buys simplicity and
 * costs a hazard the desktop token does not have: an endpoint that made a cookie out of any
 * valid token would let one person sign another into their own account. So the printed value
 * is compared, not merely verified, and it stops working the moment a password exists.
 *
 * - Given an unclaimed server, the printed link signs the browser in with a `setup` session
 *   that may set a password without an old one; once one is set, the link is refused.
 * - Any token but the printed one is refused exactly as a spent link is.
 * - The link is not single-use before the claim: opening it twice lands in one session.
 * - A password set through the ordinary change-password door (a pinned seed) ends the link.
 * - Claiming hands the claimer a working password session back, and the link's own cookie dies.
 * - A setup session left over from an earlier boot dies with the claim too.
 * - A rejected password keeps the link alive.
 * - The claimer is signed in even while a guessing spree has the login throttled.
 * - A link older than the session lifetime is re-minted rather than handed out dead.
 * - A claimed server mints no link, so a restart offers none.
