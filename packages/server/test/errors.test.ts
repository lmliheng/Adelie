/**
 * Error records, from where they are caught to the cost center that shows them.
 *
 * The log (ErrorsRepo):
 * - A summary counts every row and the unexpected ones; the top code groups by source, code and
 *   kind (none in range reads as nothing); dates and an Agent narrow every read.
 * - The recent list folds a day's repeats of one error into one row with its count and its
 *   first and last time, the day being the viewer's when the read carries an offset; a page
 *   and the row count are rows, the summary still counts records.
 * - A clear follows the caller's read: a member's leaves the unattributed rows, an admin's
 *   takes them; another Project's rows are out of reach either way.
 * - Past its cap the log evicts its oldest rows by count, never misled by id gaps.
 *
 * The recorder (ErrorRecorder):
 * - An HttpError is expected; any other failure is unexpected, an explicit kind wins over both,
 *   and a gateway close is filed by its own verdict.
 * - A non-Error is stringified and an overlong message truncated; the recorder never throws.
 * - The same error for the same Project persists once per short window, then resumes; source,
 *   code and Project each keep their own window; a full dedup table still records every
 *   distinct error and still collapses a burst.
 *
 * The stream watcher (LLM, tool and compaction failures in a Session's messages):
 * - An LLM failure the retry ladder carried is expected under its own code; an exhausted or
 *   fatal one is unexpected, worded from the abort reason, the request's own detail or the
 *   status text in that order; a user's Stop and a completion are not errors.
 * - A command tool's ordinary non-zero exit is information, not an error; a signal, a spawn
 *   failure, a timeout or a missing session manager are recorded; any other tool failure is
 *   expected under the tool's name, legacy spellings included.
 * - Parallel and nested (child Session) calls never swap names or reasons, and a child's
 *   failures are attributed to the child Agent and Session.
 * - An abandoned compaction is one unexpected row carrying its attempts and error.
 *
 * Through HTTP (onError):
 * - A business error is expected, an internal one unexpected with a 500, each attributed to
 *   the Project only when the requester has access to it (unauthenticated and non-member
 *   failures stay unattributed, and a throwing access check degrades to unattributed).
 * - The usage endpoint shows a Project's own errors; unattributed ones only to the admin.
 * - The paged error route pages within the caller's tenant, narrows to one kind on request,
 *   and refuses a page it cannot serve; it and the dashboard fold by the viewer's day, and an
 *   offset no clock uses is a 400.
 * - Clearing takes exactly the filter or trailing window on screen, never an unbounded range;
 *   a member may not clear; an admin's clear takes the unattributed rows it showed.
 * - Deleting a Project deletes its error records and nobody else's.
