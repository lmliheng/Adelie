/**
 * The hot-update network gate (hmr/routes.ts): on a non-loopback bind, hot APIs require
 * real HTTPS. `x-forwarded-proto` is caller-supplied — trusting it unconditionally would
 * let ANY client walk through the gate over plaintext just by setting a header, which is
 * exactly the case the gate exists to block. It is honored only when the deployment
 * explicitly opts in (`trustProxy` / ADELIE_TRUST_PROXY=1), same as a real reverse-proxy
 * setup requires.
 *
 * - On a non-loopback bind a spoofed `x-forwarded-proto` is refused by default, while real
 *   HTTPS on the request URL passes whatever trustProxy says.
 * - With trustProxy on, plain HTTP without the header is still refused, and the header is
 *   honored.
 * - A loopback bind needs neither HTTPS nor the header.
 *
 * A request past the gate meets the cookie check instead, so its 401 is the proof the gate let
 * it through.
