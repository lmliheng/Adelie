/**
 * `session_state` on the user channel: the run-state flip a Session list can act on.
 *
 * The per-Session `task_state` event is session-scoped and deliberately carries no id, so it
 * only ever reaches the one conversation a client has subscribed to (sse-stream.test.ts pins
 * its shape). This is its user-channel counterpart, named by `sessionId` and carrying the row
 * stamp, and what these tests pin is its SCOPE.
 *
 * - A run's running → idle flips reach the Project's owner and its members, and no other user,
 *   not even one with a live channel of their own.
 * - The event names the Session and carries the row stamp a list fetch would return.
 * - It carries hasTrace true from the first flip of a Session that had never run.
 * - It carries none of the composer state the Session channel owns.
 * - A member removed from the Project stops hearing about its Sessions.
