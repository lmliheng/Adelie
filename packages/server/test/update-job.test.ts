/**
 * The update job behind POST /api/version/update (services/update-job.ts): the progress it
 * reads off the CLI's output, its lifecycle over a scripted runner (nothing is ever spawned
 * here), and how a finished run is classified.
 *
 * - Progress stays "resolving" with no percentage until the installer announces the download;
 *   then it follows curl's bar (freshest value, clamped and rounded), and turns "installing"
 *   once the bundle verifies, ignoring later percentages.
 * - A job starts idle, runs the CLI entry once however often it is started while running,
 *   tracks progress, and ends updated with a restart needed.
 * - A refusal ends unsupported; a failure, a timeout and a spawn error end failed, and a failed
 *   run can be started again.
 * - With no CLI to run, the job ends at once as unsupported.
 * - The CLI's own refusal copy reads as unsupported, and any other clean exit — "already on the
 *   latest version" included — as updated with a restart needed.
