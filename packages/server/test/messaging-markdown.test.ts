/**
 * The Markdown conversion the four messaging channels relay a reply through: the shared parse
 * and chunking (markdown.ts), and each channel's own renderer. Four renderers because the four
 * platforms accept four different subsets; how a construct a channel CANNOT show degrades is
 * the part a chat reader notices, and model output that merely looks like markup must arrive
 * as text everywhere. Delivery itself is proven against each channel's wire fake in the
 * channel suites; nothing here sends anything.
 *
 * - Parsing reads GFM (tables, task lists) and never throws; only schemes a chat can open are
 *   safe link targets.
 * - Telegram gets its inline tags, fenced blocks in pre/code with the language, headings as
 *   bold lines, list markers as text, tables in pre, rules as text and images as links, the
 *   model's own HTML escaped and a link target's quotes escaped in the href.
 * - Feishu keeps every construct its rich text renders, escapes literal text with entities in
 *   one pass, leaves code literal, neutralizes a paragraph opening with a block marker, sends an
 *   over-long table as a code block, and wraps the content in the schema 2.0 card envelope.
 * - QQ keeps its documented constructs and rule, sends code as escaped lines and a table as
 *   its rows, and escapes with backslashes.
 * - WeChat keeps the most (code and its fence and language, tables, emphasis around Latin but
 *   not CJK), escapes a table cell's markers, widens a fence past its content's backticks,
 *   flattens over-deep headings, turns an inline image into a link, escapes outside code only.
 * - Every renderer keeps an unopenable link's label and drops only its clickability.
 * - A reply quoting an inbound file's attachment line keeps the marker literal, carries a
 *   scratchpad path through a code span byte for byte, escapes its HTML characters, and
 *   degrades a path that is genuinely emphasis without losing characters.
 * - Chunking returns a fitting reply whole, cuts between blocks, re-fences an over-long code
 *   block, cuts a paragraph between inline runs, keeps blockquote and list prefixes, bounds an
 *   unbreakable line as a last resort, and yields chunks every renderer accepts.
