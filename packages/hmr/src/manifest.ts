 * The harness.json shape (`<root>/hmr/harness.json`) and pure readers over it.

 * separate, short-lived process per invocation (see packages/cli/src/index.ts) — it
 * has no host instance to ask, only the data root's own harness.json on disk.
 * `resolveCliBundlePath` is that reader: a plain disk read, no HTTP, no boot, no
 * in-memory state.
 *
 * ONE atomic version, THREE independent artifacts: `platform`, `cli`, and `web` are
 * always written together by HmrHost's single merged upgrade path (see host.ts's
 * persistVersion), but each is content-addressed and stored on its own — a push to
 * POST /api/hmr/upgrade carries `platform` and `cli` as two separate single-file ESM
 * sources, so `cli.bundle` points at its OWN file, a different sha from
 * `platform.bundle`. They are read back together too (see host.ts's restore): a
 * partial record (e.g. `platform` present but `web` or `cli` missing) is never
 * trusted — the whole version is treated as absent instead of partially applied.
