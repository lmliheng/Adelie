/**
 * Runtime-side live resources for the hot platform tree — the registry, and nothing
 * about what a resource IS.
 *
 * The linear-state rule for live resources: a pty/child process never enters the parked
 * context document — it lives here, the document only carries its handle id, and boot
 * claims it back. Because the registry sits outside the reloadable tree, a platform swap
 * never interrupts the resource and never loses output produced during the freeze window.
 *
 * Kind-agnostic on purpose (see ./README.md): a registrant supplies its own disposer, so
 * a pushed platform can introduce a resource type this file has never heard of and still
 * have it shut down at process exit. Spawning anything — a shell, a pty, a connection —
 * is the platform's business and lives there.
