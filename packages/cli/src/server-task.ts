/**
 * Server-backed task machinery shared by `run`, `chat`, `input` and `logs -f`.
 *
 * A task is driven entirely by the server; the CLI subscribes to the Session's SSE
 * stream FIRST (so nothing is missed), POSTs the task, then consumes frames until the
 * `task_state` flip back to idle:
 *   - default-event frames are OmniMessages, fed straight into StreamRenderer.handle —
 *     the same protocol core streams, so rendering is unchanged;
 *   - `server_event` frames carry `task_state` (end detection; the first event on a
 *     fresh subscription is an authoritative snapshot), `approval_request` (the [Y/n]
 *     prompt → POST /approvals/:toolCallId) and the goal progress events.
 *
 * Reconnects ride Last-Event-ID: the stream keeps the last seen frame id and reopens
 * with it on a dropped connection; `resync_required` (buffer evicted) prints a dim
 * notice — the messages endpoint still holds the full history for `penguin logs`.
