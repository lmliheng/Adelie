/**
 * `penguin version` — what is running here.
 *
 * Two audiences, one producer. Bare, it prints the single line core computed as the build's
 * identity, which for a source build is git's own description (`v0.2.3-14-g9e8f7d6-dirty`)
 * and for a release is the plain `v0.2.3`. With `--json` it prints the whole VersionReport,
 * the same record GET /api/version serves — a bug report can be filed from either side of
 * the HTTP boundary and say the same thing.
 *
 * The JSON carries a second half the line cannot: the harness this data root has in its HMR
 * store — what a hot update put there, which a restart resumes. It is a property of the root
 * rather than of this process, so it answers "what was pushed to this machine" where the line
 * answers "what am I". The two differ whenever `penguin` runs the packaged CLI on a machine
 * that has a pushed one in its store.
 *
 * The subcommand exists alongside `-v, --version` rather than replacing it: both render
 * `describe`, so they agree, but a subcommand can take options where the global flag cannot
 * (see update.ts on how commander's program-level `--version` swallows a subcommand's own).
