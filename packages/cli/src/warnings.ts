/**
 * Drops one Node warning, and only that one.
 *
 * `commands/serve.ts` pulls in `commands/reset-password.ts`, which imports
 * `@lmliheng/penguin-server/reset-admin-password` — that reaches `node:sqlite` while
 * the module graph loads, so on a Node that still flags the builtin experimental every
 * `penguin` invocation prints
 * `ExperimentalWarning: SQLite is an experimental feature ...`, including the ones whose
 * whole output is a usage error. Nothing in the CLI's own behavior depends on the
 * builtin's stability, and the user has no action to take.
 *
 * The filter lives in the entry module rather than in a launcher flag because both ways
 * of starting the CLI reach it: the release tarball's `bin/penguin` execs
 * `node lib/dist/penguin.js` with no flags, and the dev script runs
 * `tsx packages/cli/src/penguin.ts`. `--disable-warning=ExperimentalWarning` (what the
 * server's `start` script uses) would have to be added to both, and would hide every
 * future experimental warning instead of this one.
 *
 * Import this module BEFORE anything else in the entry: ESM evaluates imports in source
 * order, and the filter has to be in place before the graph reaches `node:sqlite`.
