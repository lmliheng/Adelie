/**
 * Drift guard for the server's self-update classifier.
 *
 * POST /api/version/update (packages/server/src/http/routes/version.ts) tells a refusal
 * ("unsupported") apart from a successful run by matching `penguin update` output against
 * REFUSAL_MARKERS — five English fragments duplicated from this package's i18n catalog.
 * The server cannot import the CLI (the dependency runs the other way), so the fragments
 * are hardcoded here too, on purpose: editing a refusal message without updating
 * REFUSAL_MARKERS would silently misclassify refusals as "updated", and this test turns
 * that drift into a loud failure at edit time. If it fails, change the marker in
 * packages/server/src/http/routes/version.ts REFUSAL_MARKERS together with the string
 * (or keep the fragment intact in the new wording).
