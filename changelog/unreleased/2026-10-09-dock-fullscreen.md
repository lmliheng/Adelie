# A dock can grow to its largest size, and every dock panel is a registry definition

A dock surface with tabs can now grow to its largest size — from a header button or by dragging its edge past the maximum — with an animated transition.
The panels behind the docks became definitions in one registry, which every list of panels reads,
as the seam for panels that plugins will provide.
This is ported from upstream PenguinHarness (#961, commit `1eb13325`).

## Details

- **Full screen** is the dock at its largest, below the chat toolbar, which keeps the title and
  statistics: the right dock covers its row (the conversation column), with an open bottom dock still
  showing below it; the bottom dock (or the merged sheet on a narrow window) grows up to the toolbar.
  The navigation column stays. Enter it with the **Full screen** header button, or by dragging the
  dock's edge a little past its maximum width (height for the bottom dock); the drag snaps into full
  screen and ends there. While full, the resize handle sits on the surface's leading edge: dragging it
  back snaps out to the stored size, and so does a double-click. The header button, now **Exit full
  screen**, leaves in place. Esc does not leave: the terminal, the editor and web pages use it. The
  tab strip, **Add panel**, a terminal's **Detach** and the dock's × keep working; moving the dock or
  a tab to the other edge is put away.
- Entering and leaving animate with the theme's layout motion — the surface grows from where it
  docks and shrinks back — and are instant under reduced motion. The panel lays out at its final
  size from the first frame, so a terminal does not refit on every step. The theme's layout motion
  now also covers `top` and `left`.
- Full screen is not remembered. It ends when the conversation changes, when the window crosses the
  narrow breakpoint, when the dock is hidden or its last tab closes, and when a dock it covers has to
  show something (the right dock opening under a full-screen bottom dock), so that content never
  opens under the cover. A full-screen right dock covers no other dock, so the bottom dock opening
  or showing a terminal leaves it as it is.
- The page under the cover does not reflow, and the panels do not remount: scroll positions, a
  file preview, an editor draft and a terminal's screen are as they were on the way back. Dialogs,
  menus, tooltips and toasts still show above a full-screen dock, and the built-in browser's page
  follows it.
- The touch-only **Fill the screen** button of the bottom dock is gone; full screen replaces it on
  every pointer.
- **Panel registry.** Each panel kind (agents, Files, Memory, Trajectories, Remote control,
  Scheduled tasks, Browser) is a definition — id, name, icon, order, whether it is offered here,
  and its body component. The tab strip, **Add panel**, the empty dock's picker and the Shortcuts
  launcher list and name panels from it. A body reaches what its dock gives it through one hook,
  `useDockPanel()`: its dock, whether it is the shown tab, full screen on and off, and closing its
  tab through the close guards. A stored tab whose panel is not registered (a plugin not loaded
  yet) stays in the layout and shows a placeholder until it is, closable by its ×.
