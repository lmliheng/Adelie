On Windows, the DSH backend's ACL restricted-token runner cannot start bash, and bash is the
harness's default session shell there (Git for Windows, or the MinGit the Windows package bundles).
Every confined command already failed closed, but with the runner's own error — which names WSL or an
MSYS internal rather than the setting that fixes it. Ported from upstream PenguinHarness (#972,
commit `c03e58c4`), which the fork did not carry.

- With a bash or sh session shell on Windows, the DSH backend now fails to load, with a reason naming
  the fix: `ADELIE_SHELL=pwsh`, or `ADELIE_SHELL=powershell` on a host without PowerShell 7, then
  restart the harness. The backend is reported unavailable with that reason, so the confining tier
  shows as unavailable instead of offering a tier that refuses every command. `sessionShell` is now
  exported from `@lmliheng/penguin-core/plugin` for this check; on a runtime whose core lacks it, the
  backend loads as before.
- A confined command whose program is bash or sh is still refused on Windows before the runner is
  involved. When the program is the session shell, the error names the same fix; when it is not (a
  stdio MCP Server launched through bash), the error says only that the runner cannot start an
  MSYS-runtime program, and does not mention `ADELIE_SHELL`.
- The failure is the MSYS runtime's, not bash's, so both checks cover every program on it: the other
  POSIX shells Git for Windows and MSYS2 ship (zsh, dash, `git-bash.exe`, …) and any program in their
  `usr\bin`. The backend's README states the measured matrix — both PowerShells run confined, bash and
  sh do not start.
- The default session shell is unchanged on every platform, and the backend's behavior on Linux and
  macOS is unchanged.
- A new test covers the load check and both refusals on every platform. On a Windows host it also
  checks that the default shell fails the load, and runs both PowerShells confined through the real
  runner.
