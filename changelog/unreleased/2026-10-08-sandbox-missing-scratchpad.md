Under `workspace-write`, the Session scratchpad is bound writable into the sandbox. It is created
only when something is first written into it, and a command, an agent or the user can remove it
while the Session lives. While it was missing, bubblewrap — the Linux backend and the one inside
the Windows WSL backend — refused to start on the missing bind source, so every command and hook of
that Session failed. Ported from upstream PenguinHarness (#976, commit `cba091e3`), which the fork
did not carry.

- Under `workspace-write`, the sandbox service creates the Session scratchpad before each confined
  spawn when it is missing, and leaves an existing one untouched. Other modes do not bind it and do
  not create it.
- When the scratchpad cannot be created, the command fails with an error naming the scratchpad and
  the underlying errno; it does not run without the scratchpad.
- `SandboxPolicy.writableRoots` documents that each root exists on the host when a backend receives
  the policy, and that a backend neither creates nor skips one.
