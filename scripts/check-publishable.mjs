/**
 * A published package may not depend on one that is never published.
 *
 * `pnpm publish` rewrites every `workspace:*` dependency to that dependency's current version, so
 * a `dependencies` entry naming a `"private": true` workspace package ships as a dependency on a
 * version npm has never seen: `npm install` of the published package then fails with E404. A
 * bundled dependency (tsup `noExternal`) is not needed at runtime at all and belongs in
 * `devDependencies` — bundling is a build-time input, and `devDependencies` are not rewritten
 * into the published manifest.
 *
 * This is the shape that broke the 0.2.12 release: `packages/server` took `@lmliheng/penguin-hmr`
 * — private, and bundled — as a runtime dependency.
 *
 * With `--registry`, it additionally asks npm which of the packages a release publishes do not
 * exist there yet. That is not a defect — a new plugin has to be new once — but it is the one
 * thing the release cannot do on its own: npm's trusted publishing is configured per package, a
 * name that does not exist has no configuration, and the OIDC token exchange 404s. The release
 * job carries no fallback credential, so the first publish of a new name needs a human. Finding
 * that out from a warning on a pull request costs nothing; finding it out from the release run
 * costs a version number, which is what 0.2.13 cost.
 *
 * `--strict` turns that warning into a failure. CI warns, because adding a package is
 * legitimate and blocking every such pull request would be the wrong trade; the release
 * pre-flight fails, because the release genuinely cannot publish a name npm has never seen
 * and finding out mid-loop costs a version number.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/check-publishable.mjs [--registry] [--strict]
