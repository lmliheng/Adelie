/**
 * The builtin plugins, shipped as the npm packages they are: every `plugins/*` package with
 * a code entry is built by its own `build` script, packed by `pnpm pack` — exactly what
 * `npm publish` would send — and installed by npm into a staging directory laid out as an npm
 * prefix (`<out>/package.json` + `<out>/node_modules/<name>/…`, dependencies included). That
 * prefix is the one shape both consumers resolve from: the hot push ships it under `plugins/`
 * in its assets, the desktop build stages it beside `skills/`.
 *
 * Nothing about a package is rewritten. Its `package.json`, its `exports`, its `dist/` and its
 * `README.md` reach the target as the package's own build produced them; a dependency it
 * declares is installed beside it the way npm installs it anywhere. The SDK's runtime is not
 * among those dependencies — a plugin compiles against `@lmliheng/penguin-core`'s types
 * (a devDependency) and shares the host's copy at run time.
 *
 * A builtin plugin bundles what it runs. Every file in the prefix is a blob a push carries
 * separately, so an npm dependency tree (a grammar collection, a web framework's CJS, ESM and
 * type copies) turns one plugin into hundreds of small transfers. Its own build compiles its
 * pure-JS dependencies into `dist/`; what remains a runtime dependency is a native module whose
 * per-platform binaries cannot live inside a bundle, named in NATIVE_DEPENDENCIES — and a
 * package declaring anything else fails this build before anything is packed.
 *
 * What npm installs for those dependencies is what pnpm-lock.yaml resolves, nothing newer: the
 * prefix's manifest pins their whole locked closure as `overrides`, and a tree that differs from
 * the lockfile by version or by tarball integrity fails the build (scripts/lib/locked-prefix.mjs).
 * The licenses of those third-party packages ship beside them as `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` at the
 * prefix's root (scripts/lib/third-party-notices.mjs); a package without license text fails it.
 *
 * Cached by content: the hash over every plugin's `src/`, `package.json`, `README.md` and
 * `tsup.config.ts`, and over the lockfile entries the prefix is pinned to, names a directory
 * under `node_modules/.cache/penguin-plugins/`, and an unchanged set is not built, packed or
 * installed again — a push of an unrelated change costs nothing here. Installing needs the registry (for the dependencies) the first time only.
 *
 * Usage (a library for deploy.mjs / desktop build-assets.mjs, and a CLI):
 *   node scripts/build-plugins.mjs --out <dir>      stage the prefix into <dir>
