/**
 * Cross-platform replacement for POSIX env-prefix script lines.
 *
 *   node scripts/run-with-env.mjs VAR=value [VAR2=value2 ...] -- <command> [args...]
 *
 * Each assignment sets VAR **only when it is unset or empty** in the current environment —
 * the JS equivalent of `VAR="${VAR:-value}" cmd`, which cmd.exe cannot parse (package.json
 * scripts run under cmd.exe on Windows). An inherited value therefore wins, which is what makes
 * `ADELIE_HOME=/somewhere pnpm dev` work; a child cannot tell that apart from an exported one.
 * Because it wins, it says so: any default the environment displaced is named on stderr before
 * the command runs, so a shell-wide export cannot quietly redirect a dev script. A leading `~/` in the value expands to the user's
 * home directory (the `$HOME/...` defaults). Then the command runs with inherited stdio and
 * its exit code is propagated.
 *
 * On Windows the command is a pnpm-installed shim (tsx.cmd, vitest.cmd), which Node refuses
 * to spawn without a shell since CVE-2024-27980; those runs go through the shell with
 * quoting applied. POSIX keeps a plain shell-less spawn (bit-for-bit today's behavior).
