/**
 * Example: the SCORING LOOP in miniature — evaluate → edit → re-evaluate → keep-or-roll-back.
 *
 * This is the simplest of the three scripts here, and it is deliberately NOT self-evolution: the
 * EDIT step is hardcoded by this script (`fs.writeFile(agentsMd, DISCIPLINE)`), i.e. the HUMAN
 * writes the fix and the agent just benefits. It demonstrates the measurement machinery — a
 * deterministic rubric, averaging over runs, and the strict keep-or-roll-back rule — not an agent
 * improving itself. For GENUINE self-evolution, where the agent diagnoses its own failure and
 * writes its own AGENTS.md, see `self-evolve.ts` (single round) and `self-evolve-recursive.ts`.
 *
 * The loop this script runs:
 *   1. EVALUATE     — run the agent on a constrained task, score it against a rubric.
 *   2. EDIT (by us) — the script writes a fixed "working discipline" into the agent's AGENTS.md.
 *   3. RE-EVALUATE  — run the same task again.
 *   4. KEEP / ROLL BACK — keep the edit only if the mean score improved.
 *
 * The rubric here is a *deterministic, transparent* scorer (plain code you can read below), so the
 * before/after numbers are objective and reproducible — no hidden judge. In the full product the
 * Evaluator is driven by the `agent-evaluation` skill against a private rubric; this example
 * distills that scoring idea to its runnable core.
 *
 * It runs entirely on a local open-weight model (Ollama serving qwen3.6:35b) — see README.md for
 * the one-time setup. It uses a dedicated agent id (`self-improve-demo`) created on the fly, so
 * your existing agents are never touched.
 *
 * Run:  pnpm --dir examples/self-improving-agent start
 *   or: npx tsx examples/self-improving-agent/self-improve.ts

Aurora is a real-time analytics platform launched in Q1 2026. At peak it ingests roughly
2 million events per second through a Kafka-based pipeline. The core query engine was rewritten
in Rust after the original Go version could not keep p99 latency under control; the rewrite cut
p99 from 800ms to 120ms.

The production deployment is single-region with no failover; a multi-region rollout is scheduled
for Q3 2026. Storage is the largest cost line at about $48,000/month, driven by a 90-day
hot-retention policy; cutting retention to 30 days would reduce storage cost by roughly 55%.

When a task lists explicit rules or an exact output format, follow this discipline:

1. Read the source first with a tool before producing any output; never guess file contents.
2. Restate every rule from the task as a short checklist before you start, so none is missed.
3. Actually call the tool to write the required file — do not emit the answer as chat text.
4. Before finishing, re-read your output file and verify it against every rule (file written,
   sentence count, bullet count, word count), fixing any mismatch first.
