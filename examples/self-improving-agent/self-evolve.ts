/**
 * GENUINE self-evolution demo — the agent diagnoses its own failure and edits its OWN AGENTS.md.
 *
 * The original example (and the -hard variant) hardcode the improvement:
 *   `fs.writeFile(agentsMd, DISCIPLINE)`  ← the human writes the answer, the agent just benefits.
 * That demonstrates the *scoring loop*, but NOT self-evolution — the model does no diagnosing and
 * authors no fix.
 *
 * Here the EDIT step is done BY THE AGENT ITSELF:
 *   1. EVALUATE   — the agent writes a report for a task that says only "follow your team's format".
 *                   With a blank AGENTS.md it cannot know the (arbitrary, unguessable) house
 *                   convention, so it stably loses the convention points.
 *   2. REFLECT    — the agent is shown (a) its own rejected report and (b) a DIFFERENT report that
 *                   passed review. Nobody tells it the rules. It must compare the two, INFER the
 *                   reusable convention, and write that convention into its OWN AGENTS.md.
 *   3. RE-EVALUATE — the same task again; now the agent applies the rule it taught itself.
 *   4. KEEP / ROLL BACK — keep the self-authored AGENTS.md only if the mean score improved.
 *
 * The script never writes the convention. It only supplies a failure signal + one worked example;
 * the model does the diagnosis and persists its own improvement into its identity (AGENTS.md).
 * The reference uses a DIFFERENT subject (Borealis) than the task (Aurora), so the agent must
 * generalize the *rules*, not copy the *content*.
 *
 * Run:  cd examples/self-improving-agent && pnpm exec tsx self-evolve.ts

Aurora is a real-time analytics platform launched in Q1 2026. At peak it ingests roughly
2 million events per second through a Kafka-based pipeline. The core query engine was rewritten
in Rust after the original Go version could not keep p99 latency under control; the rewrite cut
p99 from 800ms to 120ms.

The production deployment is single-region with no failover; a multi-region rollout is scheduled
for Q3 2026. Storage is the largest cost line at about $48,000/month, driven by a 90-day
hot-retention policy; cutting retention to 30 days would reduce storage cost by roughly 55%.
