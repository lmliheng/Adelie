/**
 * RECURSIVE self-evolution — the agent improves its OWN AGENTS.md over MULTIPLE rounds, each round
 * building on the state it authored in the previous round.
 *
 * Why a second round is needed (and is the interesting part):
 *   In round 1 the agent sees ONE accepted report (Borealis). It can infer the STRUCTURE
 *   (marker line / title / classification / footer) but it CANNOT know which tokens are fixed
 *   constants vs per-report variables — a single example is ambiguous. So it generalizes the
 *   marker to a placeholder and guesses the sign-off, and stably lands mid (~7/10).
 *
 *   In round 2 the agent is given SEVERAL accepted reports from DIFFERENT projects that all share
 *   the SAME marker (`<!-- ACME-DATA-PLATFORM -->`) and the SAME footer (`Reviewed-by: Aurora
 *   Team`). Now the invariants are inferable: whatever is identical across every accepted report is
 *   a FIXED constant; whatever varies is a field. The agent reads its OWN round-1 AGENTS.md and
 *   REFINES it to lock those constants down → N+2 climbs to near-ceiling.
 *
 * This is recursion in the true sense: state_{n+1} = agent.reflect(state_n, new_evidence). The
 * script never writes a rule; it only supplies evidence and the keep/rollback signal.
 *
 * Run:  cd examples/self-improving-agent && pnpm exec tsx self-evolve-recursive.ts

Aurora is a real-time analytics platform launched in Q1 2026. At peak it ingests roughly
2 million events per second through a Kafka-based pipeline. The core query engine was rewritten
in Rust after the original Go version could not keep p99 latency under control; the rewrite cut
p99 from 800ms to 120ms.

The production deployment is single-region with no failover; a multi-region rollout is scheduled
for Q3 2026. Storage is the largest cost line at about $48,000/month, driven by a 90-day
hot-retention policy; cutting retention to 30 days would reduce storage cost by roughly 55%.
