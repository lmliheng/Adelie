/**
 * Example: an Agent that builds another Agent — programmatically, via the SDK.
 *
 * This is the "Harness for Building Agents" pillar in code. It runs entirely on a local
 * open-weight model (Ollama serving qwen3.6:35b) — see README.md for the one-time setup.
 *
 * Two phases, both driven purely through the SDK:
 *   1. BUILD  — drive `default_agent` with the `agent-initialization` skill to scaffold a brand-new
 *               agent (`commit-helper`) from a plain-language requirement.
 *   2. RUN    — load the freshly-created agent and have it do its job (write a commit message),
 *               proving the generated AGENTS.md actually shapes its behavior.
 *
 * Run:  pnpm --dir examples/build-agent-with-agent start
 *   or: npx tsx examples/build-agent-with-agent/build-agent.ts

Requirement: an agent called "commit-helper" that writes high-quality git commit messages.
Given a diff or a description of changes, it must produce a Conventional Commits message: a
\`type(scope): subject\` header (type one of feat/fix/docs/refactor/test/chore), subject in
imperative mood and under 50 characters, then a blank line and a short body explaining the "why".

Do everything the agent-initialization skill specifies: create the agent directory layout, copy the
base system_config.yaml, write a concise AGENTS.md capturing this requirement, and set the new
agent's name and description in system_config.yaml. Report the files you created when done.`;
